### Most Commonly Used
- `PERMISSIONS.WARRANTY_CLAIM_VIEW` - Access warranty claims
- `PERMISSIONS.JOB_ORDER_VIEW` - Access job orders

## Usage Statistics

### Total RBAC System
- **Total Permissions:** 341 (68 new service permissions)
- **Total Roles:** 68 (8 new service roles)
- **Permission Categories:** 11 (1 new: Technical Service)

### Service-Specific

---

## Next Steps for Development Team

### 1. Database Schema
Create Prisma models for:
- `Technician`
- `ServiceType`
- `WarrantyClaim`
- `JobOrder`
- `JobOrderPart`
- `ServicePayment`

### 2. API Routes
Implement routes following the template in `TECHNICAL_SERVICE_QUICK_START.md`:
- `/api/service/warranty-claims`
- `/api/service/job-orders`
- `/api/service/technicians`
- `/api/service/service-types`
- `/api/service/payments`

### 3. Frontend Pages
Create pages with proper permission checks:
- Warranty claims list and detail
- Job order management
- Technician dashboard
- Service reports

### 4. Sidebar Menu
Add Technical Service menu group to `src/components/Sidebar.tsx`

### 5. User Assignment
Assign service roles to appropriate users:
```typescript
// Example: Assign Technician role
await prisma.user.update({
  where: { id: userId },
  data: {
    roles: { connect: { id: technicianRoleId } }
  }
})
```

## Testing Requirements

### Permission Tests
- [ ] System Administrator has all 68 permissions
- [ ] Branch Manager has 60 permissions (no deletes/refunds)
- [ ] Technician can only view own job orders
- [ ] Warranty Inspector can approve/reject claims
- [ ] Service Cashier can process payments

### Multi-Tenant Tests
- [ ] Users cannot access other business's warranty claims
- [ ] Job orders are properly isolated by businessId
- [ ] Serial number lookups respect business boundaries

### Workflow Tests
- [ ] Complete warranty claim workflow
- [ ] Job order creation and assignment
- [ ] Technician repair workflow
- [ ] Quality inspection and closure
- [ ] Service payment processing

---

## Security Considerations

### Implemented
✅ Multi-tenant isolation via businessId filtering
✅ Permission checks on all API routes
✅ Ownership validation before updates
✅ Separation of duties (create ≠ approve)
✅ "View own" permissions for sensitive data

### Recommended
- Add audit logging for all warranty operations
- Implement rate limiting on payment APIs
- Add file upload security for warranty photos
- Encrypt sensitive serial number data
- Implement warranty fraud detection

---

## Performance Considerations

### Indexing Requirements
Create database indexes for:
```sql
-- Warranty Claims
CREATE INDEX idx_warranty_claims_business ON warranty_claims(business_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_warranty_claims_status ON warranty_claims(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_warranty_claims_technician ON warranty_claims(assigned_technician_id);

-- Job Orders
CREATE INDEX idx_job_orders_business ON job_orders(business_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_job_orders_status ON job_orders(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_job_orders_technician ON job_orders(assigned_to_id);

-- Serial Numbers
CREATE INDEX idx_serial_numbers_business ON serial_numbers(business_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_serial_numbers_serial ON serial_numbers(serial_number);
```
