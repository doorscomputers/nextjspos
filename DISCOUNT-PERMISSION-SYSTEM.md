# Discount Permission System - Simplified Approach

**Date:** 2025-01-13
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Priority:** HIGH - Loss Prevention & Fraud Control

---

## Overview

Implemented a **simplified discount-based approach** to control who can give discounts (including free items as 100% discount). This replaces the complex freebie system with a cleaner, more flexible solution.

---

## Business Logic

### Why This Approach?

1. **Simpler Implementation**: No separate FREE button or complex approval workflows
2. **More Flexible**: Managers can give partial discounts (10%, 25%, 50%) or full discounts (100% = free)
3. **Better Audit Trail**: All discounts logged in Z-reading/X-reading reports
4. **Existing Infrastructure**: Uses established discount system already in POS

### How It Works

1. **All items** are added to cart at **full selling price**
2. **Cashiers** can apply Senior Citizen (20%) and PWD (20%) discounts (statutory requirements)
3. **Authorized users only** can apply "Regular Discount" (variable amount)
4. Regular Discount can be:
   - Partial discount (e.g., ₱50 off, 10% off)
   - Full discount (100% = free item)
5. **All discounts** are tracked and printed on X-reading/Z-reading for audit

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. Permission-Based Access

**Permission Used:** `PERMISSIONS.FREEBIE_ADD`
- Reused existing permission from previous freebie system
- Controls access to "Regular Discount" option

**File:** `src/app/dashboard/pos-v2/page.tsx`

**Permission Check (Lines 908-912):**
```typescript
// Permission check for regular discount feature
const canApplyDiscount = session?.user ? hasPermission(
  session.user as unknown as RBACUser,
  PERMISSIONS.FREEBIE_ADD
) : false
```

**Conditional Rendering (Line 1263):**
```typescript
<SelectContent>
  <SelectItem value="none">No Discount</SelectItem>
  <SelectItem value="senior">Senior Citizen (20%)</SelectItem>
  <SelectItem value="pwd">PWD (20%)</SelectItem>
  {canApplyDiscount && <SelectItem value="regular">Regular Discount</SelectItem>}
</SelectContent>
```

### 2. Role Assignments

**From:** `src/lib/rbac.ts`

**Roles with Regular Discount Permission:**
- ✅ **Super Admin** - Full access
- ✅ **Branch Admin** - Full access
- ✅ **Branch Manager** - Can approve discounts
- ❌ **Regular Cashier** - NO ACCESS (cannot see Regular Discount option)

**Default Role Configuration (Lines 537-539):**
```typescript
// Branch Admin has FREEBIE_ADD permission
PERMISSIONS.FREEBIE_ADD,
PERMISSIONS.FREEBIE_APPROVE,
PERMISSIONS.FREEBIE_VIEW_LOG,
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Regular Discount option not showing for authorized user
**Solution:**

2. Verify in `src/lib/rbac.ts` - role configuration
3. Debug: Console log `session.user.permissions` in POS component

### Issue 2: Regular Discount shows for unauthorized user
**Solution:**
1. Check user's assigned role
2. Verify role does NOT have `PERMISSIONS.FREEBIE_ADD`
3. Clear browser cache and re-login

### Issue 3: Discount not showing in Z-reading
**Solution:**
1. Verify sale was completed successfully
