## 🚀 Next Steps Required

### Step 1: Run Prisma Migration (IMPORTANT)

The Bank Account system code is complete but needs database migration:

```bash
# Stop dev server
npx kill-port 3000

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Push schema to database (creates banks table)
npx prisma db push

# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

**Note**: If you get "EPERM: operation not permitted" error:
1. Close all terminals and VS Code
2. Restart your computer
3. Run the commands again

### Step 2: Test Dashboard

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard` and verify:
- [x] Page loads without errors
- [ ] Currency displays as `15,999.99` (no dollar signs)
- [ ] Metric cards show correct data
- [ ] Charts render properly
- [ ] Tables load data

### Step 3: Test Bank System (After Prisma Migration)

1. **Access Banks Menu**
   - Login to system
   - Purchases menu should be expanded
   - Click "Banks"

   - Select bank account
   - Select "Debit (Money Out)"
   - Amount: 5,000.00
   - Description: "Bank charges"
   - Submit
