## 💡 IMPORTANT NOTES

### Opt-in System
Accounting entries are **only created if you initialize Chart of Accounts**. Until then, your POS works exactly as before.

### Error Handling
If accounting integration fails, **your POS transaction still succeeds**. Accounting errors are logged but don't affect operations.

### Historical Data
Only **new transactions** (after integration) create accounting entries. Existing transactions are not retroactively recorded.

### Manual Entries
You can still create manual journal entries for special transactions (rent, utilities, loans, etc.) via the Journal Entries API.
