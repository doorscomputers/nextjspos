# Inventory Ledger - Quick Test Guide

## Quick Start

Run the complete test to verify the Inventory Ledger system:

```bash
node test-ledger-complete.js
```

**Expected Output:**
```
âœ… PASSED - Scenario 1 (WITH Correction)
âœ… PASSED - Scenario 2 (WITHOUT Correction)
ðŸŽ‰ ALL TESTS PASSED!
```

---

## What This Tests

### Scenario 1: Product WITH Correction
- **Product:** Logitech MX Master 3 Mouse (ID: 10002)
- **Flow:** Correction (+100) â†’ Purchase (+50) â†’ Sale (-20)
- **Expected:** Opening = 100, Final = 130, Variance = 0

### Scenario 2: Product WITHOUT Correction
- **Product:** Dell 27" Monitor (ID: 10004)
- **Flow:** Purchase (+100) â†’ Sale (-25) â†’ Purchase (+50) â†’ Sale (-15)
- **Expected:** Opening = 0, Final = 110, Variance = 0

---

## Key Validation Points

1. **Opening Balance Accuracy**
   - Products with corrections: Opening balance = sum of corrections
   - Products without corrections: Opening balance = 0

2. **Running Balance Calculation**
   - Each transaction updates running balance correctly
   - Purchase receipts: +quantity
   - Sales: -quantity

3. **Variance Check**
   - Variance = 0 means perfect reconciliation
   - Calculated balance matches database balance

4. **Transaction History**
   - All transactions are recorded
   - Chronologically ordered
   - Reference numbers tracked

## Test Files

| File | Purpose | Authentication Required |
|------|---------|------------------------|
| `test-ledger-complete.js` | Full test (recommended) | No |
| `test-ledger-cli.js` | Verify existing data | No |
| `test-ledger-simple.js` | API endpoint test | Yes (pending) |

## Manual Verification

After running the test, you can manually verify in the database:

```sql
-- Check Mouse (10002) stock
SELECT qtyAvailable FROM variation_location_details
WHERE productVariationId = 10002 AND locationId = 1;
-- Expected: 130

-- Check Monitor (10004) stock
SELECT qtyAvailable FROM variation_location_details
WHERE productVariationId = 10004 AND locationId = 1;
-- Expected: 110

-- Check transactions for Mouse
SELECT * FROM inventory_corrections
WHERE productVariationId = 10002;
-- Expected: 1 correction of +100

SELECT * FROM purchase_receipt_items
WHERE productVariationId = 10002;
-- Expected: 1 receipt of +50

SELECT * FROM sale_items
WHERE productVariationId = 10002;
-- Expected: 1 sale of -20
```

## Troubleshooting

### Test Fails with Wrong Balances
**Solution:** Run cleanup to remove old test data:
```javascript
// Included in test-ledger-complete.js
await cleanup();
```

### Decimal Math Issues
**Problem:** JavaScript treats Prisma Decimals as strings
**Solution:** Convert to float before math:
```javascript
const qty = parseFloat(decimal.toString());
```

### Database Connection Issues
**Check:** Ensure `.env` has correct `DATABASE_URL`
```bash
DATABASE_URL="mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/database"
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Opening Balance = Expected (100 for Mouse, 0 for Monitor)
- [ ] Final Balance = Expected (130 for Mouse, 110 for Monitor)
- [ ] Variance = 0 (perfect reconciliation)
- [ ] All transactions recorded correctly
- [ ] Running balances calculated accurately

## Next Steps

After successful test:
1. âœ… Test with your own products
2. âœ… Test with different transaction volumes
3. âœ… Test with multiple locations
4. âœ… Test API endpoint (after authentication setup)
5. âœ… Deploy to production
