## Next Steps for Deployment

### Step 1: Database Update (REQUIRED)

Choose ONE option:

**Option A: Full Re-seed (Demo/Staging Only)**
```bash
npm run db:seed
```
⚠️ This resets all demo data. NOT for production.

**Option B: Targeted Update (Production Safe)**
```bash
node scripts/update-branch-admin-permissions.mjs
```
✅ This only updates Branch Admin permissions, preserves all other data.

### Step 2: User Notification (REQUIRED)

Send this message to all Branch Admin users:

---

**Subject:** Important: Your Branch Admin Role Has Been Updated

Dear Branch Admin,

Your role permissions have been updated to better reflect supervisory responsibilities. Here's what changed:

**What You CAN'T Do Anymore:**
- Create POS sales (Cashiers will do this)
- Create purchases (Managers/Accounting will do this)
- Create stock transfers (Managers will do this)
- Create expenses, payments, or financial transactions

**What You CAN Still Do:**
- APPROVE all transactions (purchases, transfers, returns, corrections)
- Manage products, categories, brands, units
- Manage users and roles
- Manage business settings and locations
- View ALL reports and analytics
- Conduct quality control inspections

**What You NEED To Do:**
1. Logout of the system
2. Login again (this refreshes your permissions)
3. Review the attached Quick Guide

**Why This Change:**
- Better security through separation of duties
- Clear audit trails (who created vs who approved)
- Compliance with internal controls
- Less daily operational work for you

### Step 3: Session Refresh (REQUIRED)

Ask all Branch Admin users to:
1. **Logout** completely
2. **Close browser** (optional but recommended)
3. **Login** again

Their new permissions will take effect immediately.

### Step 4: UI Verification (RECOMMENDED)

Login as a Branch Admin user and verify:

| Page | Expected Behavior |
|------|------------------|
| **Dashboard** | ✅ Should load normally |
| **POS/Sales** | ❌ "Create Sale" button should be hidden |
| **Purchases** | ❌ "Create Purchase" button should be hidden |
| | ✅ "Approve Pending" button should be visible |
| **Transfers** | ❌ "Create Transfer" button should be hidden |
| | ✅ "Send/Receive" buttons should be visible |
| **Products** | ✅ "Create Product" button should be visible |
| **Users** | ✅ "Create User" button should be visible |
| **Reports** | ✅ All reports should be accessible |
| **Settings** | ✅ Business settings should be editable |

### Step 5: Test Workflows (RECOMMENDED)

Test the approval workflows:

1. **Purchase Approval:**
   - Login as Manager → Create purchase order
   - Login as Branch Admin → Approve purchase order
   - ✅ Should work

2. **Transfer Approval:**
   - Login as Manager → Create transfer request
   - Login as Branch Admin → Send transfer
   - Login as receiving location → Confirm receipt
   - Login as Branch Admin → Complete transfer
   - ✅ Should work

3. **Return Approval:**
   - Login as Cashier → Create customer return
   - Login as Branch Admin → Approve return
   - ✅ Should work

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If you need to revert the changes:

```bash
# Restore previous version from git
git checkout HEAD~1 src/lib/rbac.ts

# Re-seed database
npm run db:seed

# Ask users to logout/login
```

**Note:** Only use rollback if critical issues arise. The new configuration is more secure.
