## üîß Configuration

### Adding New Permissions

1. Add to `src/lib/rbac.ts`:
```typescript
export const PERMISSIONS = {
  // ... existing permissions
  NEW_MODULE_VIEW: 'new_module.view',
  NEW_MODULE_CREATE: 'new_module.create',
  // ...
}
```

2. Add to role permissions in `DEFAULT_ROLES`

3. Run seed to create in database:
```bash
npm run db:seed
```

### Adding New Roles

1. Add to `src/lib/rbac.ts` in `DEFAULT_ROLES`:
```typescript
export const DEFAULT_ROLES = {
  // ... existing roles
  NEW_ROLE: {
    name: 'New Role Name',
    permissions: [
      PERMISSIONS.DASHBOARD_VIEW,
      PERMISSIONS.PRODUCT_VIEW,
      // ... add permissions
    ],
  },
}
```

2. Update seed file to create the role

3. Run seed:
```bash
npm run db:seed
```

## üìä Database Schema

### Key Tables

**users** - User accounts
- `id`, `username`, `email`, `password` (hashed)
- `businessId` (tenant isolation)
- `allowLogin`, `maxSaleDiscount`

**roles** - Role definitions
- `id`, `name`, `businessId`
- `isDefault` (system vs custom)

**permissions** - Permission definitions
- `id`, `name` (e.g., "user.create")

**user_roles** - User-Role assignment (many-to-many)
- `userId`, `roleId`

**role_permissions** - Role-Permission assignment (many-to-many)
- `roleId`, `permissionId`

**user_permissions** - Direct user permissions (optional, not yet implemented in UI)
- `userId`, `permissionId`

**user_locations** - User-Location assignment
- `userId`, `locationId`

**business_locations** - Branch/store locations
- `id`, `businessId`, `name`, `city`, `state`

---

## üö® Important Notes

### Session Token Caching
- User permissions are cached in JWT token
- **Users must re-login** to see new permissions after role/permission changes
- Trade-off for performance (avoids DB query on every request)

### Default Roles Protection
- System default roles (Super Admin, Branch Admin, etc.) **cannot be edited or deleted**
- UI disables edit/delete buttons for system roles
- API enforces this restriction

### Permission Requirements

To access pages:
- **Users Page**: Requires `USER_VIEW` permission
- **Roles Page**: Requires `ROLE_VIEW` permission

To perform actions:
- **Create User**: Requires `USER_CREATE`
- **Edit User**: Requires `USER_UPDATE`
- **Delete User**: Requires `USER_DELETE`
- **Create Role**: Requires `ROLE_CREATE`
- **Edit Role**: Requires `ROLE_UPDATE`
- **Delete Role**: Requires `ROLE_DELETE`

### Field-Level Permissions (Per Your Request)

You mentioned: *"Future menus will be included in permission selection per role, and fields can be disabled per role like Cost cannot be seen by Cashiers"*

This is already supported! Here's how:

**Example: Hide purchase price from cashiers**

In your component:
```typescript
import { usePermissions } from '@/hooks/usePermissions'

function ProductCard({ product }) {
  const { can } = usePermissions()

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>{product.name}</h3>
      <p>Selling Price: ${product.sellingPrice}</p>

      {/* Only show purchase price to users with permission */}
      {can(PERMISSIONS.PRODUCT_VIEW_PURCHASE_PRICE) && (
        <p>Purchase Price: ${product.purchasePrice}</p>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Current Permission for Viewing Costs:**
- `PRODUCT_VIEW_PURCHASE_PRICE` - Can view product purchase prices
- ‚úÖ Branch Admin: **HAS** this permission
- ‚úÖ Branch Manager: **HAS** this permission
- ‚úÖ Accounting Staff: **HAS** this permission
- ‚ùå Regular Staff: **DOES NOT HAVE**
- ‚ùå Regular Cashier: **DOES NOT HAVE**

## üéØ Next Steps / Future Enhancements

1. **Direct User Permissions**
   - Allow assigning permissions directly to users (not just via roles)
   - UI for user-specific permission overrides

2. **Audit Logging**
   - Track all user/role/permission changes
   - Show who did what and when

3. **Email Notifications**
   - Notify users when their account is created
   - Password reset functionality

4. **Advanced Features**
   - Two-factor authentication
   - Session management (view active sessions, logout from other devices)
   - Bulk user operations (import from CSV, bulk role assignment)
   - Permission templates for quick role creation

5. **Field-Level Permissions**
   - Create more granular permissions for specific fields
   - Example: `PRODUCT_EDIT_PRICE`, `SALE_APPLY_DISCOUNT_ABOVE_X`

6. **Menu/Route Permissions**
   - As you add new features, add corresponding permissions
   - Update role permissions in seed file
   - Use `can()` in components to show/hide features
