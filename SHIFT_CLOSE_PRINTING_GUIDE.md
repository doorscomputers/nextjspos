## Why URL Bar Shows in Screenshots

The URL bar you see (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/shifts/close?shiftId=2`) is NOT part of the actual printout.

**This is from**:
- Taking a screenshot while in print preview
- Browser chrome (URL bar, toolbars) is captured in screenshots

**It will NOT print if you**:
- Use "Save as PDF" ‚Üí No URL bar in PDF
- Use browser print with "Headers and footers" unchecked
- Print directly to thermal/receipt printer

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Z Reading Not Showing"

**Check**:
1. Did shift close successfully?
2. Scroll down on the print preview - Z Reading is on Page 2
3. Try "Save as PDF" and check the PDF has 2 pages

### "Cash Denominations Missing"

**This means**:
- Z Reading `cashDenomination` data is null/empty
- Check if you entered cash counts during shift close
- Verify denominations were submitted in the close form

**To Fix**:
1. Cash denominations should be entered BEFORE closing shift
2. If already closed, use "Re-print Readings" feature
3. Check database: `cash_denominations` table for the shift

### "Colors Not Printing"

1. In print dialog, enable **"Background graphics"**
2. Or use "Save as PDF" which preserves all colors

### "Content Cut Off"

1. Change print margins to "Minimum" or "None"
2. Try landscape orientation for wide tables
3. Check "Scale to fit" option in print dialog

## Re-Printing Closed Shifts

### From Sidebar Menu:

1. Go to **Readings** ‚Üí **Readings History** (sidebar)
2. Find the closed shift by:
   - Shift Number
   - Date
   - Cashier name
3. Click **"View/Print"** or **"Re-print"** button
4. Follow printing steps above

### From Dashboard:

1. Go to **Dashboard** ‚Üí **Recent Shifts**
