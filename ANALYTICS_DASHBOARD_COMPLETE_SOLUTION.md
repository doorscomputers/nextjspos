# Analytics Dashboard - Complete Solution

## âœ… All Issues Resolved

### What Was Wrong
1. **Stale Next.js cache** - The .next folder had outdated compiled routes
2. **Port conflicts** - Old servers on ports 3000/3001 conflicting with port 3002
3. **Prisma type error** - businessId was being passed as string instead of int
4. **.env port mismatch** - NEXTAUTH_URL was set to wrong port

### What I Fixed
1. âœ… Killed all conflicting Node processes
2. âœ… Updated .env to use port 3002
3. âœ… Fixed businessId type conversion in API
4. âœ… **Cleared .next cache** (critical!)
5. âœ… Verified all database queries work
6. âœ… Confirmed user has proper permissions
