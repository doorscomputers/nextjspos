# ✅ Direct GRN Entry - Implementation Complete!

## 🎉 What Was Built

### 1. **Database Schema Updates** ✅
**Files Modified:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma`

**Changes:**
1. **PurchaseReceipt Model:**
   - ✅ `purchaseId` - Now **OPTIONAL** (can be NULL)
   - ✅ `supplierId` - Now **REQUIRED** (direct supplier link)
   - ✅ Can create GRN with or without Purchase Order

2. **PurchaseReceiptItem Model:**
   - ✅ `purchaseItemId` - Now **OPTIONAL** (NULL for direct entry)
   - ✅ Stores product, variation, quantity, cost regardless of source

**Migration Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Database is in sync

---

### 2. **Bulletproof API Endpoint** ✅
**File Created:**
- `src/app/api/purchases/receipts/route.ts` (POST method added)

**Features:**
- ✅ **Dual Workflow Support:**
  - With Purchase Order: `purchaseId` provided → Uses supplier from PO
  - Direct Entry: `supplierId` provided → No PO needed

- ✅ **Comprehensive Validation:**
  - Checks user permissions (`PURCHASE_RECEIPT_CREATE`)
  - Validates supplier belongs to business
  - Validates all required fields
  - Prevents unauthorized access

- ✅ **Transaction Safety:**
  - Uses Prisma `$transaction` for atomic operations
  - Creates GRN, items, inventory movements atomically
  - Rolls back everything if any step fails

- ✅ **Inventory Management (CRITICAL):**
  - Creates `InventoryMovement` record for each item
  - Updates `ProductVariation.currentStock`
  - Maintains balance quantity history
  - Records unit cost and total cost

- ✅ **Audit Trail:**
  - Logs all GRN creation with details
  - Tracks workflow type (PO vs Direct Entry)
  - Records user who created the GRN

**API Endpoint:** `POST /api/purchases/receipts`

**Request Body Example (Direct Entry):**
```json
{
  "supplierId": 5,
  "locationId": 2,
  "receiptDate": "2025-10-09",
  "notes": "Walk-in purchase from market",
  "items": [
    {
      "productId": 10,
      "productVariationId": 15,
      "quantityReceived": 100,
      "unitCost": 50.00,
      "notes": "Fresh stock"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Request Body Example (From PO):**
```json
{
  "purchaseId": 25,
  "locationId": 2,
  "receiptDate": "2025-10-09",
  "notes": "Delivery from PO-000025",
  "items": [
    {
      "productId": 10,
      "productVariationId": 15,
      "quantityReceived": 95,
      "purchaseItemId": 45
    }
