# üì¶ Direct GRN Entry & Defective Item Tracking - Implementation Plan

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Direct GRN Entry (COMPLETED - Schema)

### What Changed:
The `PurchaseReceipt` model now supports creating Goods Received Notes **WITHOUT** a Purchase Order.

### Database Schema Changes:
```prisma
model PurchaseReceipt {
  // BEFORE: Required Purchase Order
  // purchaseId Int

  // AFTER: Optional Purchase Order
  purchaseId Int?      // Can be NULL now!
  purchase   Purchase?

  // NEW: Direct supplier reference
  supplierId Int      // Required - must specify supplier
  supplier   Supplier // Direct link to supplier
}
```

### Two Workflows Now Supported:

#### **Workflow 1: With Purchase Order** (Planned Purchases)
```
1. Create PO ‚Üí Send to supplier
2. Supplier delivers
3. Create GRN from PO
4. Link: GRN ‚Üí PO ‚Üí Supplier
5. Inventory updated
```

#### **Workflow 2: Direct GRN** (Walk-in/Unplanned Purchases) ‚≠ê **NEW!**
```
1. Go to supplier, buy items
2. Return to store
3. Create GRN directly:
   - Select supplier (required)
   - Enter items manually
   - Enter quantities & costs
   - NO Purchase Order needed!
4. Link: GRN ‚Üí Supplier (direct)
5. Inventory updated
```

## üî® Phase 2: Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Update GRN Create Page ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS
**File**: `src/app/dashboard/purchases/receipts/new/page.tsx`

**What needs to be done**:
1. Add toggle: "Create from Purchase Order" vs "Direct Entry"
2. If "Direct Entry":
   - Show supplier dropdown (required)
   - Show empty items table
   - Allow manual product selection
   - Allow manual quantity/cost entry
3. If "From Purchase Order":
   - Show PO selector
   - Pre-fill items from selected PO
   - Allow editing received quantities

### Task 2: Update GRN API
**File**: `src/app/api/purchases/receipts/route.ts`

**What needs to be done**:
1. Validate:
   - If `purchaseId` provided: Use supplier from PO
   - If no `purchaseId`: Require `supplierId` in request
2. Create GRN with or without PO link
3. Update inventory correctly in both cases
4. Create accounts payable entry linked to supplier

### Task 3: Update GRN List Page
**File**: `src/app/dashboard/purchases/receipts/page.tsx`

**What needs to be done**:
- Show "Direct Entry" badge for GRNs without PO
- Display supplier name from direct link if no PO

## üìä Phase 3: Product Purchase History Report

### Report Specifications:
**Columns**:
1. SKU
2. Product Name
3. Last Purchase Cost
4. Last Supplier Name
5. Last Purchase Qty
6. Last Purchase Amount (Qty √ó Cost)
7. Last Purchase Date

**File to create**: `src/app/dashboard/reports/product-purchase-history/page.tsx`

### SQL Logic (Pseudocode):
```sql
SELECT
  p.sku,
  p.name,
  last_purchase.cost AS last_cost,
  last_purchase.supplier_name,
  last_purchase.quantity,
  last_purchase.amount,
  last_purchase.date
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN LATERAL (
  SELECT
    pi.unitCost AS cost,
    s.name AS supplier_name,
    pi.quantity,
    (pi.quantity * pi.unitCost) AS amount,
    pu.purchaseDate AS date
  FROM purchase_items pi
  JOIN purchases pu ON pi.purchaseId = pu.id
  JOIN suppliers s ON pu.supplierId = s.id
  WHERE pi.productId = p.id
  ORDER BY pu.purchaseDate DESC
  LIMIT 1
) last_purchase ON true
```

## üîç Phase 4: Serial Number Tracking for Defective Returns

### The Problem:
**Scenario**: Customer returns defective iPhone
- **Question**: Which supplier did we buy it from?
- **Why it matters**: Need to return to correct supplier
- **Current issue**: Same product from multiple suppliers - can't tell which one!

### The Solution: Serial Number Tracking ‚ú®

### How It Works:

#### Step 1: Record Serial Numbers When Purchasing
```
Purchase from Supplier A (ABC Electronics):
  - iPhone 14 Pro, Qty: 3
  - Serial Numbers:
    1. SN-ABC-001 (IMEI: 111111111)
    2. SN-ABC-002 (IMEI: 222222222)
    3. SN-ABC-003 (IMEI: 333333333)

Purchase from Supplier B (XYZ Tech):
  - iPhone 14 Pro, Qty: 2
  - Serial Numbers:
    1. SN-XYZ-001 (IMEI: 444444444)
    2. SN-XYZ-002 (IMEI: 555555555)
```

**Database Storage**:
```prisma
model PurchaseItem {
  // Existing fields...
  serialNumbers Json? // Array of {serialNumber, imei, condition}
}

// Example JSON:
[
  {
    "serialNumber": "SN-ABC-001",
    "imei": "111111111",
    "condition": "new",
    "receivedDate": "2025-01-15"
  },
  {
    "serialNumber": "SN-ABC-002",
    "imei": "222222222",
    "condition": "new",
    "receivedDate": "2025-01-15"
  }
]
```

#### Step 2: Track Serial Number in Sales
```
Customer buys iPhone 14 Pro:
  - Select specific serial number: SN-ABC-001
  - System records:
    - Product sold
    - Serial number used
    - Original supplier (ABC Electronics)
    - Original purchase date
```

**Database Storage**:
```prisma
model SaleItem {
  // Existing fields...
  serialNumbers Json? // Array of sold serial numbers with origin info
}

// Example JSON:
[
  {
    "serialNumber": "SN-ABC-001",
    "imei": "111111111",
    "originalPurchaseId": 123,
    "originalSupplierId": 45,
    "supplierName": "ABC Electronics",
    "purchaseDate": "2025-01-15",
    "soldDate": "2025-02-01"
  }
]
```

#### Step 3: Customer Returns (Defective)
```
Customer returns iPhone with SN-ABC-001:
  1. Scan/enter serial number: SN-ABC-001
  2. System looks up:
     - Original supplier: ABC Electronics
     - Purchase date: 2025-01-15
     - Purchase Order: PO-00123
     - Original cost: $900
  3. Create customer return record
  4. Option to create supplier return to ABC Electronics
```

#### Step 4: Return to Supplier
```
Create Supplier Return:
  - Supplier: ABC Electronics (auto-filled from serial number)
  - Product: iPhone 14 Pro
  - Serial Number: SN-ABC-001
  - Reason: Defective
  - Original PO: PO-00123
  - Refund Amount: $900
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema for Serial Number Tracking

### Already Exists (Good News!):
```prisma
model PurchaseReceiptItem {
  serialNumbers Json? @map("serial_numbers")
  // Stores: [{ serialNumber, imei, condition }]
}

model SupplierReturnItem {
  serialNumbers Json? @map("serial_numbers")
  // Can track which serial numbers returned to supplier
}
```

### Need to Add:
```prisma
model SaleItem {
  // Add this field:
  serialNumbers Json? @map("serial_numbers")
  // Will store: [{
  //   serialNumber,
  //   imei,
  //   originalPurchaseId,
  //   originalSupplierId,
  //   supplierName
  // }]
}

model CustomerReturn {
  // Create this new model
  id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
  businessId Int

  saleId Int
  sale Sale @relation(...)

  returnNumber String @unique
  returnDate DateTime

  customerId Int
  customer Customer @relation(...)

  status String // pending, approved, completed
  returnReason String // defective, warranty, wrong_item, damaged

  totalAmount Decimal
  refundMethod String // cash, credit, replacement

  notes String?

  createdBy Int
  approvedBy Int?
  approvedAt DateTime?

  items CustomerReturnItem[]
}

model CustomerReturnItem {
  id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
  customerReturnId Int
  customerReturn CustomerReturn @relation(...)

  saleItemId Int
  saleItem SaleItem @relation(...)

  productId Int
  productVariationId Int

  quantity Decimal
  unitPrice Decimal

  // Serial numbers being returned
  serialNumbers Json? // { serialNumber, imei, defectDescription }

  // Link to original supplier (from serial number lookup)
  originalSupplierId Int?
  originalPurchaseId Int?

  condition String // defective, damaged, warranty_claim
  defectDescription String?

  canReturnToSupplier Boolean @default(false)

  notes String?
}
```

## üí° Benefits of This System

### For Direct GRN:
- ‚úÖ No need to create fake POs for walk-in purchases
- ‚úÖ Faster data entry for emergency purchases
- ‚úÖ Still maintains supplier tracking
- ‚úÖ Inventory stays accurate
- ‚úÖ Accounts payable still tracked

### For Serial Number Tracking:
- ‚úÖ **Know exactly which supplier** to return defective items to
- ‚úÖ **Warranty claims** - can prove when/where item was purchased
- ‚úÖ **Prevent fraud** - track item history from purchase to sale to return
- ‚úÖ **Supplier quality tracking** - see which suppliers have more defective items
- ‚úÖ **Inventory accuracy** - track individual high-value items
- ‚úÖ **Lost/Stolen tracking** - know which serial numbers are missing
