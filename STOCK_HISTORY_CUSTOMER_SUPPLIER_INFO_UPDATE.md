# Stock History - Customer/Supplier Information Update ‚úÖ

## Date: October 20, 2025
## Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

---

## Overview

Replaced generic "System" placeholder in the **Customer/Supplier Information** column with **meaningful business information** to help users quickly identify who/what was involved in each transaction.

---

## What Changed

### Before ‚ùå
All transactions showed:
- **Customer/Supplier Information**: "System"

**Problem**: Not helpful for auditing or understanding transaction context.

---

### After ‚úÖ

Each transaction type now shows **relevant business information**:

| Transaction Type | Customer/Supplier Information Shows |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Purchase** | Supplier name (e.g., "ABC Supplier Corp") |
| **Sale** | Customer name (e.g., "John Doe") or "Walk-in Customer" |
| **Transfer Out** | Destination location (e.g., "To: Main Store") |
| **Transfer In** | Source location (e.g., "From: Main Warehouse") |
| **Purchase Return** | Supplier name (e.g., "XYZ Trading") |
| **Customer Return** | Customer name (e.g., "Jane Smith") |
| **Stock Correction** | "Stock Correction" (more descriptive than "System") |
| **Opening Stock** | User who created it (from product history) |
