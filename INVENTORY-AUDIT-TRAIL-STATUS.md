# Inventory Audit Trail - Complete Status

## 🎯 Objective
**Bulletproof inventory monitoring where ALL changes in inventory are logged in an audit trail**

## ✅ Currently Implemented Audit Logging

### 1. **Inventory Corrections** ✅
**File:** `src/app/api/inventory-corrections/route.ts`
- Creates audit log when correction is created
- Logs: user, IP, timestamp, metadata (product, location, old/new quantities)
- **Status:** COMPLETE

### 2. **Inventory Correction Approval** ✅
**File:** `src/app/api/inventory-corrections/[id]/approve/route.ts`
- Creates audit log when correction is approved
- Logs: approver, timestamp, status change
- **Status:** COMPLETE

### 3. **Physical Inventory Import** ✅
**File:** `src/app/api/physical-inventory/import/route.ts`
- Creates audit log for each bulk correction imported
- Logs: file name, product details, quantities, user
- **Status:** COMPLETE

### 4. **Bulk Product Operations** ✅
**Files:**
- `src/app/api/products/bulk-add-to-location/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/products/bulk-remove-from-location/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/products/bulk-toggle-active/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/products/bulk-delete/route.ts`
- **Status:** COMPLETE

### 5. **Opening Stock Unlock** ✅
**File:** `src/app/api/products/unlock-opening-stock/route.ts`
- Logs when opening stock is manually unlocked
- **Status:** COMPLETE

## ⚠️ Missing Audit Logging (CRITICAL)

### 1. **Opening Stock Set** ✅ FIXED
**File:** `src/app/api/products/[id]/opening-stock/route.ts`
**Status:** COMPLETE - Audit logging now implemented
**Impact:** All initial inventory values are now logged
**Details:**
- Creates audit log when opening stock is set
- Logs: user, IP address, timestamp, product details
- Metadata includes: location names, variation names, quantities, unit costs
**Priority:** HIGH (RESOLVED)

### 2. **Stock Transactions** ❓
**Table:** `stock_transactions`
**Issue:** Need to verify if these are logged separately
**Types:**
- Sales (stock OUT)
- Purchases (stock IN)
- Stock transfers (stock MOVE)
- Returns (stock ADJUST)
**Priority:** CRITICAL

### 3. **Product Creation/Update** ❓
**Files:** Product CRUD routes
**Issue:** Need audit log when products are created/modified
**Priority:** MEDIUM

### 4. **Variation Location Details Changes** ❓
**Table:** `variation_location_details`
**Issue:** Direct updates to qty_available should be logged
**Priority:** HIGH

## 📊 Audit Log Database Structure

```prisma
model AuditLog {
  id          Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  businessId  Int      @map("business_id")
  business    Business @relation(fields: [businessId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  action      String   // create, update, delete, approve, import, etc.
  entityType  String   @map("entity_type")   // product, stock, correction, etc.
  entityId    Int?     @map("entity_id")     // ID of the affected entity

  userId      Int?     @map("user_id")
  username    String?  // Denormalized for reporting
  ipAddress   String?  @map("ip_address")

  metadata    Json?    // Flexible field for details

  createdAt   DateTime @default(now()) @map("created_at")

  @@map("audit_logs")
}
```

## 🔍 What Should Be In metadata Field

### For Stock Changes:
```json
{
  "productId": 123,
  "productName": "Dell Monitor",
  "variationId": 456,
  "variationName": "24 inch",
  "locationId": 1,
  "locationName": "Tuguegarao",
  "oldQty": 10,
  "newQty": 15,
  "difference": +5,
  "reason": "Physical count",
  "transactionType": "opening_stock|correction|sale|purchase|transfer"
}
```

### For Opening Stock:
```json
{
  "productId": 123,
  "productName": "Dell Monitor",
  "openingStockSet": [
    {
      "locationId": 1,
      "locationName": "Tuguegarao",
      "variationId": 456,
      "variationName": "24 inch",
      "quantity": 100,
      "unitCost": 5000.00
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🎯 Recommended Actions (Priority Order)

### 1. Add Audit Logging to Opening Stock ⚡ URGENT
**File:** `src/app/api/products/[id]/opening-stock/route.ts`
**Action:** Add createAuditLog call after opening stock is saved
**Code:**
```typescript
await createAuditLog({
  businessId: parseInt(businessId),
  action: 'set_opening_stock',
  entityType: 'opening_stock',
  entityId: parseInt(productId),
  userId: parseInt(user.id),
  username: user.username,
  ipAddress: request.headers.get('x-forwarded-for') || request.headers.get('x-real-ip') || 'unknown',
  metadata: {
    productId: parseInt(productId),
    productName: product.name,
    openingStockSet: openingStock.map(entry => ({
      locationId: entry.locationId,
      variationId: entry.variationId,
      quantity: entry.quantity,
      unitCost: entry.unitCost
    }))
  }
})
```

### 2. Verify Stock Transactions Are Logged ⚡ URGENT
**Action:** Check if `stockTransactions` table has trigger/logic to create audit logs
**Files to check:**
- Sales routes
- Purchase routes
- Transfer routes

### 3. Create Audit Trail Viewer UI 📊 HIGH
**Page:** `/dashboard/audit-trail`
**Features:**
- Filter by date range
- Filter by user
- Filter by entity type (product, stock, correction)
- Filter by action (create, update, delete, set_opening_stock)
- Export to Excel
- Show full metadata details

### 4. Add Audit Log Reports 📈 MEDIUM
**Reports needed:**
- All stock movements for a product
- All actions by a user
- All changes to a specific location's inventory
- Opening stock history

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Set opening stock → Check audit log created
- [ ] Create inventory correction → Check audit log created
- [ ] Approve inventory correction → Check audit log created
- [ ] Import physical inventory → Check audit logs for all corrections
- [ ] Create sale → Check stock transaction + audit log
- [ ] Create purchase → Check stock transaction + audit log
- [ ] Transfer stock → Check stock transaction + audit log
- [ ] Bulk add products to location → Check audit log
- [ ] Unlock opening stock → Check audit log

## 📋 Audit Trail Requirements Summary

### What MUST be logged:
1. ✅ WHO made the change (user ID, username)
2. ✅ WHEN the change was made (timestamp)
3. ✅ WHAT was changed (entity type, entity ID)
4. ✅ HOW it was changed (action: create/update/delete/approve)
5. ⚠️ OLD and NEW values (in metadata)
6. ✅ WHERE the change came from (IP address)
7. ✅ WHY the change was made (reason field in metadata)

### Immutability:
- Audit logs should NEVER be deleted
- Audit logs should NEVER be updated
- Use `createdAt` only (no updatedAt)
- Consider database-level protection (triggers)

## 🔐 Data Integrity Rules

1. **No direct UPDATE on variation_location_details.qty_available**
   - All changes MUST go through:
     - Opening stock API
     - Inventory correction API
     - Stock transaction API

2. **Atomic Transactions**
   - Stock change + Audit log = single database transaction
   - If audit log fails, stock change should rollback

3. **Validation Before Change**
   - Check sufficient stock before deduction
   - Prevent negative stock (configurable)
   - Validate location access

## 📖 Next Steps

1. **✅ COMPLETE:** Add audit logging to opening stock route
2. **Next:** Verify all stock transactions create audit logs
3. **This Week:** Build audit trail viewer UI
4. **This Month:** Add comprehensive reports and analytics
5. **Phase 2:** Begin implementation of MASTER-INVENTORY-ROADMAP.md (Serial numbers, Purchases, Sales, Transfers)

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-06 (Updated after completing opening stock audit logging)
**Status:** Opening stock audit logging COMPLETE ✅ - Now ready to verify stock transactions
**Priority:** Critical - Required for regulatory compliance and forensic analysis
