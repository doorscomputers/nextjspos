# "Allow Sender to Approve" Feature - Implementation Complete ✅

**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Feature:** SOD Toggle for Small Teams with Limited Manpower

---

## What Was Added

A new **Separation of Duties (SOD) toggle** has been added to help small businesses with limited staff:

### **"Allow Sender to Approve"**
- **Purpose:** Lets the person who sent a transfer also be able to check/approve it
- **Use Case:** Small locations with 1-2 staff members who need flexibility
- **Default:** DISABLED (false) - for security
- **Restriction:** Only **Super Admin** can change this setting

---

## Where to Find It

1. **Log in as Super Admin**
2. Navigate to: **Settings** → **SOD Rules** (Separation of Duties)
3. Scroll to: **Stock Transfer Rules** section
4. Look for: **"Allow Sender to Approve"** toggle
5. Enable it to allow the same person to send and approve transfers

---

## What Changed

### 1. Database Schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
```prisma
model BusinessSODSettings {
  // ...existing fields...

  // NEW: Send -> Check/Approve (allows person who sent to also check/approve)
  allowSenderToCheck Boolean @default(false) @map("allow_sender_to_check")

  // ...other fields...
}
```

### 2. SOD Validation Logic (`src/lib/sodValidation.ts`)
```typescript
case 'check':
  // Existing: Creator cannot check
  if (transfer.createdBy === userId && !settings.allowCreatorToCheck) {
    return { allowed: false, ... }
  }

  // NEW: Sender cannot check (unless enabled)
  if (transfer.sentBy === userId && !settings.allowSenderToCheck) {
    return {
      allowed: false,
      code: 'SOD_SENDER_CANNOT_CHECK',
      suggestion: 'Admin can enable "Allow Sender to Approve" in Settings'
    }
  }
```

### 3. Settings UI (`src/app/dashboard/settings/sod-rules/page.tsx`)
New toggle added with label:
- **Label:** "Allow Sender to Approve"
- **Description:** "Person who sent can check/approve (for small teams)"

### 4. API Endpoint (`src/app/api/settings/sod-rules/route.ts`)
Updated to save/load the new `allowSenderToCheck` field.

## Current SOD Settings

After installation, your settings are:

```
Transfer SOD Enforcement: ✅ ENABLED
├─ Allow Creator to Check: ✅ ENABLED
├─ Allow Sender to Approve: ❌ DISABLED (new toggle)
└─ Allow Checker to Send: ✅ ENABLED
```

---

## How to Use

### Scenario: Small Branch with Only 2 Staff

**Before (Strict SOD):**
1. User A creates transfer → ✅
2. User A submits for checking → ✅
3. User A tries to approve → ❌ BLOCKED (creator cannot check)
4. **Need User B** to approve → ⏳ Stuck if User B is unavailable

**After Enabling "Allow Creator to Check":**
1. User A creates transfer → ✅
2. User A submits and approves → ✅ (now allowed)
3. User A sends → ✅
4. User B at destination receives → ✅

## Important Security Notes

⚠️ **When to Enable:**
- Small locations with 1-2 staff
- Temporary staff shortages (sick leave, vacation)
- Training periods
- Emergency situations

⚠️ **When to KEEP DISABLED:**
- Large locations with 3+ staff
- Financial compliance requirements
- High-value inventory locations
- Locations with fraud history

⚠️ **Super Admin Only:**
- This setting can ONLY be changed by users with **Super Admin** role
- Regular managers and staff CANNOT modify SOD rules
- All changes are logged in audit trail

---

## Testing the Feature

### Step 1: Enable the Setting
1. Log in as **Super Admin**
2. Go to **Settings** → **SOD Rules**
3. Enable **"Allow Sender to Approve"**
4. Click **Save SOD Rules**
5. Verify success message appears

### Step 2: Test the Workflow
1. Create a new transfer (any location)
2. Submit for checking
3. Try to approve it (should work now!)
4. Send the transfer
5. Complete at destination

## Database Migration Status

The following SOD toggles work together:

| Toggle | What It Allows |

| **Allow Checker to Send** | Person who approved can send |
| **Allow Sender to Approve** ⭐ NEW | Person who sent can approve (rare) |
