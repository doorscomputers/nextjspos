# GRN (Goods Received Note) Approval Process - Implementation Notes

## Current Status

The GRN approval process is **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED** in the codebase! Here's how it works:

### Two-Step Process

#### Step 1: Receiving/Encoding (GRN Creation)
- **Who**: User with `purchase.receipt.create` permission
- **What**: Encoder creates a GRN from a Purchase Order or directly
- **Status**: `pending` (awaiting approval)
- **Inventory Impact**: **NO CHANGE YET** ‚ùå
- **User tracking**: `receivedBy` field stores the encoder's user ID
- **Timestamp**: `receivedAt` field stores when GRN was created

#### Step 2: Approval (Inventory Update)
- **Who**: User with `purchase.receipt.approve` permission
- **What**: Approving officer reviews and approves the GRN
- **Status**: Changes from `pending` to `approved`
- **Inventory Impact**: **STOCK IS ADDED** ‚úì
- **User tracking**: `approvedBy` field stores the approver's user ID
- **Timestamp**: `approvedAt` field stores when GRN was approved
- **Actions performed on approval**:
  1. Updates `PurchaseReceipt` status to 'approved'
  2. Creates `InventoryMovement` records (audit trail)
  3. Updates `ProductVariation.currentStock`
  4. Creates `AuditLog` entry
  5. Optionally updates Purchase Order status

### Verification Checklist

The approval page (`src/app/dashboard/purchases/receipts/[id]/page.tsx`) includes a comprehensive verification checklist that the approver must acknowledge before clicking "Approve & Update Inventory":

1. ‚úì All product details (name, SKU, variation) are correct
2. ‚úì Quantities received match the physical count
3. ‚úì Unit costs and total values are accurate
4. ‚úì Supplier information is correct
5. ‚úì Serial numbers (if applicable) are properly recorded
6. ‚úì No damaged or defective items are included

The user MUST check the verification box before the approval button becomes active.

### Audit Trail - Product History

The system creates a comprehensive audit trail when inventory is added via GRN approval:

#### 1. Inventory Movement Record
```typescript
{
  movementType: 'purchase_receipt',
  referenceType: 'purchase_receipt',
  referenceId: receipt.id.toString(),  // Links to GRN
  quantityIn: quantityReceived,
  balanceQuantity: newBalance,
  unitCost: cost,
  totalCost: totalCost,
  notes: `GRN ${receiptNumber} from PO ${purchaseOrderNumber}`,  // Shows source!
  createdBy: approvingUserId,
  locationId: warehouseLocationId,
  productId: productId,
  productVariationId: variationId
}
```

**Key Points**:
- `notes` field clearly indicates: **"GRN GRN-000001 from PO PO-000123"**
- For direct entry (no PO): **"GRN GRN-000002 (Direct Entry)"**
- `referenceType` and `referenceId` provide database-level traceability
- `createdBy` shows who approved (added stock)
- `locationId` shows which warehouse received the goods

#### 2. Audit Log Entry
```typescript
{
  userId: approvingUserId,
  action: 'APPROVE_PURCHASE_RECEIPT',
  entityType: 'purchase_receipt',
  entityId: receiptId.toString(),
  details: {
    receiptNumber: 'GRN-000001',
    purchaseId: purchaseOrderId,
    itemsApproved: itemCount,
    totalQuantity: totalQtyAdded,
    totalValue: totalCostAdded
  }
}
```

#### 3. Product History Query Example

To view a product's history showing where stock came from:

```sql
SELECT
  im.createdAt,
  im.movementType,
  im.referenceType,
  im.referenceId,
  im.quantityIn,
  im.balanceQuantity,
  im.notes,
  u.name as approved_by,
  l.name as location
FROM InventoryMovement im
LEFT JOIN User u ON im.createdBy = u.id
LEFT JOIN BusinessLocation l ON im.locationId = l.id
WHERE im.productId = ? AND im.productVariationId = ?
ORDER BY im.createdAt DESC
```

Example output:
```
Date       | Type            | Qty In | Balance | Notes                          | Approved By | Location
-----------|-----------------|--------|---------|--------------------------------|-------------|----------
2025-10-09 | purchase_receipt| 100    | 150     | GRN GRN-000003 from PO PO-0005 | John Smith  | Warehouse
2025-10-08 | purchase_receipt| 50     | 50      | GRN GRN-000001 (Direct Entry)  | Jane Doe    | Warehouse
```

This makes it **VERY EASY** to track:
- ‚úÖ Why stock was increased (Purchase, not a manual adjustment)
- ‚úÖ Which GRN number added the stock
- ‚úÖ Which PO it came from (if any)
- ‚úÖ Who approved the GRN (accountability)
- ‚úÖ When it was approved
- ‚úÖ Which location received it

### API Endpoints

#### GET /api/purchases/receipts
- Lists all GRNs with filtering by status and location
- Returns: GRN number, PO number, supplier, quantities, status, received by, approved by

#### GET /api/purchases/receipts/[id]
- Shows detailed GRN with all items and approval workflow
- Displays verification checklist for pending GRNs

#### POST /api/purchases/receipts/[id]/approve
- **CRITICAL**: This is where inventory is added!
- Validates approver has `purchase.receipt.approve` permission
- Creates inventory movements with full audit trail
- Updates product stock levels
- Records approver and approval timestamp

### Permission Requirements

| Action | Permission | Role Assignment |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| Create GRN | `purchase.receipt.create` | Warehouse Manager, Admin |
| View GRN | `purchase.receipt.view` | Warehouse Manager, Admin, Manager |
| Approve GRN | `purchase.receipt.approve` | Warehouse Manager, Admin |

### Current Issue

**Problem**: User Jheirone cannot access the GRN page
**Cause**: Jheirone HAS the permissions via the "Warehouse Manager" role, but the session might not be updated
**Solution**: User needs to log out and log back in to refresh the session with updated permissions

## Files Implementing the GRN Approval Process

1. **API Routes**:
   - `src/app/api/purchases/receipts/route.ts` - List & Create GRNs
   - `src/app/api/purchases/receipts/[id]/route.ts` - View GRN details
   - `src/app/api/purchases/receipts/[id]/approve/route.ts` - **APPROVAL LOGIC**

2. **Frontend Pages**:
   - `src/app/dashboard/purchases/receipts/page.tsx` - GRN list with filters
   - `src/app/dashboard/purchases/receipts/[id]/page.tsx` - **APPROVAL PAGE** with verification checklist
   - `src/app/dashboard/purchases/receipts/new/page.tsx` - Create new GRN

3. **Database Models** (Prisma):
   - `PurchaseReceipt` - Stores GRN header (status, dates, users)
   - `PurchaseReceiptItem` - Stores individual items received
   - `InventoryMovement` - **AUDIT TRAIL** of stock changes
   - `AuditLog` - System-wide audit log

## Workflow Example

### Scenario: Warehouse receives 100 units of Product A from PO-0001

1. **Receiving Clerk (Jheirone)** - 9:00 AM
   - Logs into system
   - Goes to Purchases ‚Üí View PO-0001
   - Clicks "Receive Goods (GRN)"
   - Enters quantities received
   - Clicks "Create GRN & Add Stock"
   - System creates GRN-000005 with status `pending`
   - **Inventory: NO CHANGE** (still 50 units in stock)

2. **Warehouse Manager (Alex)** - 9:30 AM
   - Goes to Purchases ‚Üí Goods Received Notes (GRN)
   - Sees GRN-000005 in "Pending Approval" list
   - Clicks "View" to see details
   - Reviews verification checklist:
     - ‚úì Product details correct
     - ‚úì Quantity matches physical count (100 units)
     - ‚úì Unit cost correct (‚Ç±500.00)
     - ‚úì Supplier correct
     - ‚úì No damaged items
   - Checks the verification box
   - Clicks "Approve & Update Inventory"
   - System:
     - Changes GRN status to `approved`
     - Creates InventoryMovement record with notes "GRN GRN-000005 from PO PO-0001"
     - Updates ProductVariation.currentStock from 50 to 150
     - Records approvedBy: Alex, approvedAt: 2025-10-09 09:30:00
     - Creates AuditLog entry
   - **Inventory: UPDATED** (now 150 units in stock)

3. **Product History Query** - Anytime
   - User queries InventoryMovement for Product A
   - Sees: "100 units added via GRN GRN-000005 from PO PO-0001, approved by Alex on 2025-10-09"
   - Clear audit trail of where stock came from!

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Separation of Duties**: Encoder ‚â† Approver (fraud prevention)
2. **Data Accuracy**: Physical verification before inventory update
3. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of who did what and when
4. **Traceability**: Easy to track stock origin (PO ‚Üí GRN ‚Üí Inventory)
5. **Compliance**: Meets internal control requirements
6. **Accountability**: Every action is logged with user ID and timestamp

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ GRN approval process is fully implemented
2. ‚úÖ Audit trail is comprehensive
3. ‚úÖ Permission system is in place
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **PENDING**: User needs to re-login to get updated permissions
5. üìù **TODO**: Test the full workflow end-to-end
6. üìù **TODO**: Ensure approval notifications/alerts are working
7. üìù **TODO**: Add reports for pending approvals
