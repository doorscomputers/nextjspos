## Visual Guide - What You'll See

```
Assign Location (Branch) (Optional for Admin roles - user can access all locations)
[Dropdown: -- All Locations (No Restriction) --]
ℹ️ User will have access to all locations within the business
```

### For Transactional Roles (Cashier, Manager, Staff):
```
Assign Location (Branch) *
[Dropdown: -- Select Location --]
⚠️ Please select a location for transactional roles
```

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Cannot save Admin user without location
**Solution:** This should now be fixed. If issue persists:
1. Ensure you're using the updated code
2. Check that the role name is exactly "Branch Admin" or "Super Admin"
3. Clear browser cache and reload

### Problem: Admin user can only see one location
**Solution:**
1. Edit the user
2. Verify "Branch Admin" role is assigned
3. Change location to "-- All Locations (No Restriction) --"
4. Save changes

### Problem: Want to restrict Admin to specific location
**Solution:**
1. Keep the Branch Admin role
2. Select a specific location from dropdown
3. User will have admin permissions but only for that location

---

## Best Practices

1. **Use Branch Admin for business owners/managers**
   - Leave location empty for full business access
   - Or assign specific location if restriction needed

2. **Use Super Admin ONLY for platform operators**
   - Never assign to regular business users
   - Reserved for SaaS owners managing multiple businesses

3. **Always assign location for operational staff**
   - Cashiers, sales staff, warehouse staff
   - Ensures proper transaction tracking and accountability

4. **Review user access regularly**
   - Audit who has admin access
   - Remove admin role when employee changes position

5. **Use least privilege principle**
   - Grant minimum necessary permissions
   - Create custom roles for specific needs
