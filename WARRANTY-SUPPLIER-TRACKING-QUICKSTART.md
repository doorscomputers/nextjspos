# Supplier Tracking for Warranty - Quick Start Guide

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Before:** When a customer returns a defective item for warranty, you don't know which supplier provided it (same product from multiple suppliers).

**After:** Every serial number is linked to its supplier automatically when goods are received. One API call tells you exactly which supplier to return the item to!

---

## 🚀 Quick Implementation Checklist

### ✅ Step 1: Database Updated
```bash
✓ Added supplier_id to product_serial_numbers table
✓ Added index for fast queries
✓ Prisma schema updated
✓ Database migrated
```

### ✅ Step 2: GRN Approval Enhanced
**File:** `src/app/api/purchases/receipts/[id]/approve/route.ts`

Now captures supplier ID when creating serial numbers:
```typescript
supplierId: receipt.supplierId  // ← Auto-links to supplier!
```

### ✅ Step 3: New API Endpoints

#### Get Supplier from Serial Number
```bash
GET /api/serial-numbers/{serialNumber}/supplier
```

#### Auto-Create Supplier Return from Warranty
```bash
POST /api/warranty-claims/{id}/create-supplier-return
```

## 📋 How to Use

### Scenario: Customer Returns Defective Phone

#### 1️⃣ **Customer Brings Item**
- Serial Number: SN12345
- Issue: "Screen not working"

#### 2️⃣ **Lookup Supplier (1 API Call)**
```bash
GET /api/serial-numbers/SN12345/supplier
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "serialNumber": "SN12345",
  "isUnderWarranty": true,
  "supplier": {
    "id": 5,
    "name": "ABC Electronics",
    "email": "supplier@abc.com",
    "mobile": "+1234567890"
  },
  "warrantyEndDate": "2026-01-15"
}
```

#### 3️⃣ **Create Warranty Claim**
```bash
POST /api/warranty-claims
{
  "serialNumber": "SN12345",
  "issueDescription": "Screen not working",
  "claimType": "supplier_warranty"
}
```

#### 4️⃣ **Auto-Create Supplier Return (1 Click)**
```bash
POST /api/warranty-claims/{claimId}/create-supplier-return
```

**Result:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "supplierReturn": {
    "returnNumber": "SR-202501-0001",
    "supplierName": "ABC Electronics",
    "status": "pending"
  }
}
```

✅ **Done!** Return is ready to ship to **ABC Electronics** (correct supplier!)

## 🔍 Key Features

### Automatic Supplier Identification
- ✅ No manual lookup needed
- ✅ 100% accuracy
- ✅ Works for all serial numbered items

### Complete Audit Trail
```
Purchase (ABC Electronics)
  → GRN (Serial SN12345 linked to ABC)
    → Sale to Customer
      → Warranty Claim
        → Return to ABC Electronics ✅
```

### Quality Tracking
```sql
-- Defect rate by supplier
SELECT supplier_name,
       defect_count,
       total_units,
       defect_rate_percent
FROM supplier_quality_report
ORDER BY defect_rate DESC;
```

---

## 🛠️ For Existing Data

If you have old serial numbers without supplier info:

```sql
-- Backfill supplier_id from purchase receipts
UPDATE product_serial_numbers psn
SET supplier_id = pr.supplier_id
FROM purchase_receipts pr
WHERE psn.purchase_receipt_id = pr.id
  AND psn.supplier_id IS NULL;
```

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: What if serial number has no supplier?
**A:** Older items added before this feature. You can:
1. Check purchase receipt manually
2. Update via SQL or admin panel

### Q: Can I track items without serial numbers?
**A:** This feature is for serial numbered items only. For non-serialized items, use batch/lot tracking (future enhancement).

### Q: What if we buy from multiple suppliers for same product?
**A:** Perfect! This is exactly why this feature exists. Each serial number knows its specific supplier.

### Q: Can suppliers see warranty claims?
**A:** Not yet, but a supplier portal is planned for future enhancement.

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Always approve GRN** - Serial numbers only get supplier link when GRN is approved
2. **Scan correctly** - Wrong serial number = wrong supplier lookup
3. **Check warranty dates** - System shows if item is under warranty
4. **Verify before shipping** - Double-check supplier before sending return
