# Stock History V2 - URL Parameter Fix

## Problem Fixed
When clicking "Product Stock History" from the products page, the stock-history-v2 page would load slowly and wouldn't automatically show the selected product's history.

## Root Cause
The page didn't read the `productId` URL parameter, so it just waited for manual product search.

## Solution Implemented

### Changes Made to `src/app/dashboard/reports/stock-history-v2/page.tsx`:

1. **Added URL parameter reading**:
   - Import `useSearchParams` from Next.js
   - Read `productId` from URL query string

2. **Added automatic product loading**:
   - New `loadProductFromUrl()` function fetches product details
   - Automatically selects the product and its first variation
   - Auto-selects user's primary location if available
   - Triggers automatic stock history loading

3. **Added loading states**:
   - Shows "Loading product details..." when fetching from URL
   - Better UX feedback

## How It Works Now

### Flow:
1. User clicks "Product Stock History" (⋮ menu) in products page
2. Navigates to: `/dashboard/reports/stock-history-v2?productId=123`
3. Page **automatically**:
   - Reads `productId=123` from URL
   - Fetches product details from API
   - Sets product as selected
   - Sets user's primary location (if available)
   - Loads stock history immediately

### Result:
- ✅ **Instant loading** - No more waiting
- ✅ **Auto-populated** - Product and location pre-selected
- ✅ **History displayed** - Shows immediately if location is set

## Testing Instructions

1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/dashboard/products
2. Find any product with stock enabled
3. Click the three-dot menu (⋮)
4. Click "Product Stock History"
5. **Expected**: Page loads quickly with product already selected and history showing

## Fallback Behavior

If user navigates directly without `productId`:
- Page loads normally
- Shows search box
- User can manually search and select product (original behavior)

## Technical Details

- Product type handling: Works with both `single` and `variable` products
- Variation selection: Automatically picks first variation
- Location selection: Uses user's `primaryLocationId` if available
- Error handling: Graceful fallback if product doesn't exist
