## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Create Supplier Return" button not showing
**Solution:** Button only appears when:
- Item has a supplier (not null)
- Item status is 'in_stock'
- Check that the serial number was properly linked to a supplier during GRN approval

### Issue: Warranty dates are null
**Possible Causes:**
1. Product doesn't have a warranty template assigned
2. GRN was approved before warranty system was implemented
3. Product variation's `warrantyId` is null

**Solution:**
- Edit the product and assign a warranty template
- For old serial numbers, you may need to manually update warranty dates in database

### Issue: Can't access Warranty Management page
**Solution:** User needs `SETTINGS_UPDATE` permission
- Check user's role permissions in RBAC settings
- Add permission to the role

### Issue: Serial Lookup doesn't show warranty info
**Solution:** Clear cache and refresh. The serial lookup API was updated to include warranty calculation.
