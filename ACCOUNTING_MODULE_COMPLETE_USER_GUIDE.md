## üß™ How to Test with Sample Data

Since you don't have accounting entries yet, here are **two ways to test**:

### Option 1: Use Existing Sales/Purchase Transactions (Automatic)

Your existing inventory transactions **automatically generate accounting entries**!

**What Gets Generated Automatically:**
1. **Sales** ‚Üí Revenue + COGS journal entries
2. **Purchases** ‚Üí Inventory + Accounts Payable entries
3. **Inventory Adjustments** ‚Üí Adjustment entries

**How to Test:**
1. Make a few sales through POS
2. Create a purchase order
3. Adjust inventory quantities
4. Go to **Accounting ‚Üí Income Statement**
5. Select date range covering your transactions
6. Click "Generate Report"
7. You should see:
   - Revenue from sales
   - COGS from sales
   - Operating expenses
   - Net income (profit/loss)

### Option 2: Initialize Chart of Accounts & Create Manual Entries

**Step 1: Initialize Chart of Accounts**

Run this API endpoint (or create initialization page):
```
POST /api/accounting/chart-of-accounts/initialize
```

This creates the standard accounts:
- **Assets**: Cash (1000), Accounts Receivable (1100), Inventory (1200), Equipment (1500)
- **Liabilities**: Accounts Payable (2000), Sales Tax (2100)
- **Equity**: Owner's Equity (3000), Retained Earnings (3100)
- **Revenue**: Sales Revenue (4000), Service Revenue (4100)
- **Expenses**: COGS (5000), Rent (5100), Salaries (5200), Utilities (5300)

**Step 2: Create Journal Entries**

You can create manual journal entries through the API (or build a UI page):

```typescript
// Example: Recording a sale
POST /api/accounting/journal-entries
{
  "entryDate": "2025-10-26",
  "description": "Sale #1234 - Cash sale",
  "lines": [
    {
      "accountCode": "1000", // Cash
      "debit": 1000,
      "credit": 0,
      "description": "Cash received from customer"
    },
    {
      "accountCode": "4000", // Sales Revenue
      "debit": 0,
      "credit": 1000,
      "description": "Sales revenue"
    }
  ]
}

// Example: Recording an expense
POST /api/accounting/journal-entries
{
  "entryDate": "2025-10-26",
  "description": "Rent payment for October",
  "lines": [
    {
      "accountCode": "5100", // Rent Expense
      "debit": 2000,
      "credit": 0,
      "description": "Monthly rent"
    },
    {
      "accountCode": "1000", // Cash
      "debit": 0,
      "credit": 2000,
      "description": "Cash paid for rent"
    }
  ]
}
```

## üìñ Understanding Each Report (For Non-Accountants)

### 1. Balance Sheet

**What it shows**: What you own, what you owe, and the owner's stake

**Formula**: Assets = Liabilities + Equity (always!)

**How to read it**:
- **ASSETS** (green section): What you OWN
  - Current Assets: Cash, money owed to you, inventory
  - Fixed Assets: Equipment, vehicles, buildings
- **LIABILITIES** (orange section): What you OWE
  - Current: Bills due soon
  - Long-term: Loans, mortgages
- **EQUITY** (blue section): Owner's stake
  - Owner's investment + accumulated profits

**Key Metrics**:
- **Working Capital**: Can you pay bills? (should be positive)
- **Current Ratio**: Ability to pay short-term debts (above 1.0 is good)
- **Debt-to-Equity**: How much you owe vs. own (lower is better)

**Date Selection**: Pick any date to see your financial position "as of" that date

---

### 2. Income Statement (Profit & Loss)

**What it shows**: Did you make money?

**Formula**: Profit = Revenue - Expenses

**How to read it**:
- **REVENUE** (green): Money earned from sales
- **COST OF GOODS SOLD** (orange): What you paid for products sold
- **GROSS PROFIT** (blue): Revenue - COGS
- **OPERATING EXPENSES** (red): Costs to run the business
- **NET INCOME** (bottom line): Your profit or loss

**Profit Status**:
- üéâ **PROFIT** (green): You made money! Revenue > Expenses
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **LOSS** (red): Expenses > Revenue - review costs
- ‚ûñ **BREAK EVEN** (yellow): Revenue = Expenses - no profit or loss

**Period Selection**: Select start and end dates (e.g., "This Month")

**Quick Period Buttons**:
- This Month
- Last Month
- This Quarter
- This Year

---

### 3. Trial Balance

**What it shows**: Are your books balanced correctly?

**Golden Rule**: Total Debits MUST equal Total Credits

**How to read it**:
- Lists ALL accounts with their debit and credit balances
- Shows account codes, names, and types
- Bottom row shows totals

**Status Indicator**:
- ‚úÖ **BALANCED** (green): Debits = Credits - your books are correct!
- ‚ùå **UNBALANCED** (red): There's an error - fix before generating statements

**When to check**: Before period closing or generating financial statements

**Common issues if unbalanced**:
- Manual journal entry error
- Missing half of a transaction
- Data entry mistake
- System error (rare)

---

### 4. General Ledger

**What it shows**: Detailed transaction history for each account

**Think of it as**: A bank statement for EVERY account (not just cash)

**How to read it**:
- Each account shows:
  - Opening balance
  - All transactions (debits and credits)
  - Running balance after each transaction
  - Closing balance
- Click account names for explanations

**Filters Available**:
- Date range
- Specific account code
- Account type (asset, liability, etc.)

**Use this to**:
- Drill down into account activity
- Verify transactions
- Audit records
- Find specific entries

## üìù Important Notes

### Data Safety
- ‚úÖ Existing system completely untouched
- ‚úÖ No changes to current transactions
- ‚úÖ All accounting tables are separate
- ‚úÖ Can be disabled by removing permissions

### Multi-Tenant Safe
- ‚úÖ All queries filtered by `businessId`
- ‚úÖ Users can only see their own business's data
- ‚úÖ Complete data isolation

### Automatic Integration
Your existing transactions automatically create accounting entries through `src/lib/financialImpact.ts`:
- **Sales** ‚Üí Revenue + COGS entries
- **Purchases** ‚Üí Inventory + Payables
- **Adjustments** ‚Üí Correction entries
- **Transfers** ‚Üí No GL impact (same entity)

### Audit Trail
- ‚úÖ Every accounting change is logged
- ‚úÖ Who, what, when, where tracked
- ‚úÖ Old/new values stored
- ‚úÖ IP address and user agent captured

---

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the Accounting menu"
**Solution**: You need `ACCOUNTING_ACCESS` permission. Login as Super Admin or have admin grant you this permission.

### "Balance Sheet shows $0 for everything"
**Cause**: No accounting entries yet.
**Solution**: Either:
1. Make sales/purchases to auto-generate entries, OR
2. Initialize Chart of Accounts and create manual entries

### "Trial Balance is unbalanced"
**Cause**: Error in journal entries - debits don't equal credits.
**Solution**: Review journal entries, find the error, and correct it. Do NOT generate financial statements until balanced.

### "Reports are slow to load"
**Cause**: Large number of transactions.
**Solution**: Use financial snapshots (coming in Phase 3) to cache reports.

### "Dark mode text is hard to read"
**Solution**: This shouldn't happen - we've designed for dark mode. Please report specific pages/sections.
