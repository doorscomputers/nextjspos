## 🔴 Problem Statement

### The Issue
**Inventory Ledger shows 7.00 units, but Physical Stock (system) shows 6.00 units.**

This is **UNACCEPTABLE** because:
- ❌ Financial reports are inaccurate
- ❌ Can't trust inventory valuation
- ❌ Reorder points are wrong
- ❌ Could indicate theft or fraud
- ❌ Audit trail is broken

### What Should Happen
```
Physical Stock (variation_location_details.qty_available)
  MUST ALWAYS EQUAL
Ledger Calculated (SUM of stock_transactions)
```

### Your Specific Case
```sql
Product: 1048A JNSX HIGH BACK MESH CHAIR WITH HEAD REST (1048AJNSX)
Location: Main Warehouse
Variation: Default

Ledger Transactions:
  + Opening Stock: 1.00
  + GRN Received: 9.00
  - Transfer Out (TR-202510-0001): -2.00
  - Transfer Out (TR-202510-0003): -1.00
  ─────────────────────────────────
  = Ledger Calculated: 7.00 ✅ CORRECT

Physical Stock: 6.00 ❌ WRONG

Variance: -1.00 (Physical is 1 unit less than ledger)
```

**Diagnosis:** One transfer deducted from physical stock but **failed to create a ledger entry** (`stock_transaction` record).

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Why This Happened

**Scenario 1: Transaction Failure (Most Likely)**
```typescript
1. Transfer SEND endpoint called
2. Stock deducted from variation_location_details ✅
3. Database transaction committed ✅
4. BUT: stockTransaction.create() failed silently ❌
5. Result: Physical stock down, no ledger entry
```

**Scenario 2: Race Condition**
```typescript
1. Two operations tried to update same stock simultaneously
2. One succeeded fully, one partially
3. Result: Inconsistent state
```

**Scenario 3: Legacy Workflow Mix**
```typescript
1. Transfer used old "receive" endpoint
2. Receive endpoint has TWO workflows (legacy + modern)
3. Code path taken didn't create proper ledger entry
```

## 🎯 Complete Solution Overview

We've implemented **5 layers of protection**:

| Layer | What It Does | When It Activates |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| **1. SQL Diagnostic** | Find & fix existing issues | Manual - run when needed |
| **2. Receive Endpoint Fix** | Prevent double deductions | Every transfer receive |
| **3. Validation Library** | Detect discrepancies | API calls, scheduled checks |
| **4. Reconciliation API** | Report & fix discrepancies | Manual or automated |
| **5. Post-Transaction Validation** | Verify every stock change | After EVERY stock operation |

## SOLUTION 1: Find & Fix Current Discrepancies

### File
`scripts/fix-inventory-discrepancy.sql`

### Purpose
Diagnostic and repair SQL script to find and correct existing discrepancies.

### Usage

#### Step 1: Find Discrepancies
```sql
-- Run this first to see all problematic items
-- See beginning of fix-inventory-discrepancy.sql
```

**Output:**
```
Product Name | SKU | Location | System Stock | Ledger Calculated | Variance | Diagnosis
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Chair 1048A  | ... | Main WH  | 6.00        | 7.00             | -1.00    | Physical too low
```

#### Step 2: View Transaction History
```sql
-- Replace with your variation_id and location_id
WHERE st.product_variation_id = 1632
  AND st.location_id = 1
```

**Output:**
```
Date | Type | Qty Change | Balance After | Reference | Notes
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
10/18 | opening_stock  | +1.00 | 1.00  | CSV Import
10/19 | stock_received | +9.00 | 10.00 | GRN-202510-0001
10/19 | transfer_out   | -2.00 | 8.00  | TR-202510-0001
10/20 | transfer_out   | -1.00 | 7.00  | TR-202510-0003
```

#### Step 3: Fix Discrepancies

**Option A: Sync Physical to Ledger (RECOMMENDED)**
```sql
-- Uncomment Step 4 in the SQL file
-- This sets physical stock = ledger calculated stock
```

**Option B: Create Correction Entry**
```sql
-- Adds a correction transaction to bring ledger to match physical
-- Use if physical stock is the "source of truth"
```

#### Step 4: Verify Fix
```sql
-- Run Step 6 verification query
-- Should show: total_discrepancies = 0
```

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT
- **BACKUP DATABASE FIRST** before running any fixes
- Review discrepancies manually before auto-fixing
- Investigate WHY the discrepancy occurred

---

## SOLUTION 2: Prevent Double Deductions

### File
`src/app/api/transfers/[id]/receive/route.ts`

### What Changed

**Before (DANGEROUS):**
```typescript
if (!transfer.stockDeducted) {
  await transferStockOut(...)  // Deduct from source
}
await transferStockIn(...)  // Add to destination
```

**After (SAFE):**
```typescript
if (!transfer.stockDeducted) {
  console.warn('Legacy workflow detected')
  await transferStockOut(...)
} else {
  // VERIFY ledger entry exists!
  const ledgerEntry = await findTransferOutEntry(...)
  if (!ledgerEntry) {
    throw new Error('CRITICAL: Stock deducted but no ledger entry!')
  }
}
await transferStockIn(...)
```

### Benefits
- ✅ Detects missing ledger entries immediately
- ✅ Prevents receive from completing with broken data
- ✅ Forces investigation of the root cause
- ✅ Logs warnings for legacy workflows

## SOLUTION 5: Post-Transaction Validation

### File
`src/lib/stockOperations.ts`

### What It Does

After **EVERY** stock operation (add, deduct, transfer in, transfer out, sale, purchase, etc.), the system now:

1. Updates physical stock
2. Creates ledger entry (stock_transaction)
3. Creates product history
4. **✨ NEW: Validates consistency**

### Code Added
```typescript
// After creating stock_transaction and product_history:
if (ENABLE_STOCK_VALIDATION) {
  try {
    await validateStockConsistency(
      productVariationId,
      locationId,
      tx,
      `After ${type} operation`
    )
  } catch (validationError) {
    console.error('⚠️ STOCK VALIDATION FAILED:', validationError.message)
    // Logged for investigation
    // Optionally: throw error to fail transaction
  }
}
```

### Configuration
Set in `.env`:
```bash
# Enable post-transaction validation (default: true)
ENABLE_STOCK_VALIDATION=true

# To disable (not recommended in production):
# ENABLE_STOCK_VALIDATION=false
```

### Behavior Options

**Option 1: Log Only (Current - SAFE)**
- Validation runs after every stock operation
- If discrepancy detected: **logs error** but **allows transaction**
- Allows operations to continue while collecting diagnostic data
- Recommended for initial deployment

**Option 2: Strict Mode (Uncomment in code)**
```typescript
// Uncomment this line in stockOperations.ts:
throw validationError
```
- Validation runs after every stock operation
- If discrepancy detected: **throws error** and **rolls back transaction**
- Prevents ANY operation from creating inconsistent data
- Recommended after confirming no existing discrepancies

## 📖 How to Use

### Immediate Actions (Do This Now)

#### 1. Find Current Discrepancies
```bash
# Connect to database
psql -U postgres -d ultimatepos_modern

# Run diagnostic query from scripts/fix-inventory-discrepancy.sql
\i scripts/fix-inventory-discrepancy.sql
```

#### 2. Review and Fix
```bash
# See which items have discrepancies
# Investigate the cause
# Run fix queries (Step 4 in SQL file)
```

#### 3. Enable Validation
```bash
# Add to .env if not present
echo "ENABLE_STOCK_VALIDATION=true" >> .env

# Restart server
npm run dev
```

### Daily Operations

#### Monitor Inventory Health
```bash
# API call or create a cron job
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/reports/inventory-reconciliation \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

#### Scheduled Integrity Check
```javascript
// Create a script: scripts/daily-integrity-check.mjs
import { performIntegrityCheck } from '@/lib/stockValidation'

const health = await performIntegrityCheck(1)
if (health.discrepanciesFound > 0) {
  console.error(`⚠️ ALERT: ${health.discrepanciesFound} discrepancies found!`)
  // Send email alert
  // Create notification
}
```

**Run daily via cron:**
```bash
0 0 * * * cd /path/to/project && node scripts/daily-integrity-check.mjs
```

### When Issues Occur

#### If Receive Fails with "CRITICAL INVENTORY ERROR"
```
1. DO NOT PANIC - transaction was prevented, no damage done
2. Check server logs for details
3. Run SQL diagnostic to find missing ledger entry
4. Investigate which transfer caused the issue
5. Fix manually using SQL or API
6. Retry the receive operation
```

#### If Validation Logs Errors
```
1. Check console/logs for "⚠️ STOCK VALIDATION FAILED"
2. Note the variation ID, location ID, and operation type
3. Run integrity check API to get full details
4. Fix using reconciliation API or SQL
5. Investigate root cause to prevent recurrence
```

## 🧪 Testing & Verification

### Test Plan

#### Test 1: Create Transfer and Verify Ledger
```bash
1. Create transfer: Main Warehouse → Main Store (5 units)
2. Send transfer
3. Verify ledger shows transfer_out at Main Warehouse
4. Complete/Receive transfer
5. Verify ledger shows transfer_in at Main Store
6. Run integrity check - should show 0 discrepancies
```

#### Test 2: Simulate Missing Ledger Entry
```sql
-- Manually create discrepancy (for testing)
UPDATE variation_location_details
SET qty_available = qty_available - 1
WHERE product_variation_id = 1632 AND location_id = 1;

-- Run integrity check
SELECT * FROM {discrepancy query}

-- Should detect the issue
-- Fix using API or SQL
```

#### Test 3: Verify Receive Endpoint Validation
```bash
1. Create and send a transfer
2. Manually delete the transfer_out ledger entry:
   DELETE FROM stock_transactions
   WHERE type = 'transfer_out' AND reference_id = {transfer_id}
3. Try to receive the transfer
4. Should fail with: "CRITICAL: Stock deducted but no ledger entry!"
5. This confirms validation is working ✅
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Validation Always Failing

**Cause:** Existing discrepancies preventing new operations

**Fix:**
```bash
1. Disable validation temporarily:
   ENABLE_STOCK_VALIDATION=false

2. Fix all existing discrepancies using SQL or API

3. Re-enable validation:
   ENABLE_STOCK_VALIDATION=true
```

### Issue: Performance Impact

**Cause:** Validation adds DB queries to every stock operation

**Fix:**
```bash
# Option 1: Keep enabled, optimize queries (add indexes)
CREATE INDEX idx_stock_transactions_consistency
ON stock_transactions(product_variation_id, location_id, deleted_at);

# Option 2: Disable real-time validation, use scheduled checks
ENABLE_STOCK_VALIDATION=false
# Run integrity check daily via cron instead
```

### Issue: False Positives (Floating Point)

**Cause:** Small rounding differences

**Fix:** Validation already has 0.0001 tolerance built in. If still seeing issues, increase tolerance in `stockValidation.ts`.
