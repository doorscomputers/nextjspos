# Purchase Order Suggestions System - Complete Guide

## Executive Summary

The **Purchase Order Suggestions** feature is an intelligent inventory replenishment system that analyzes sales velocity, current stock levels, and supplier lead times to automatically recommend when and how much to reorder. This prevents stockouts while optimizing cash flow.

## How It Works

### 1. Data Analysis Engine

The system performs these calculations for every product:

```
Current Stock (Company-Wide) = Sum of all location stocks
Sales Velocity = Total sales last 30 days ÷ 30 days
Days Until Stockout = Current Stock ÷ Sales Velocity
Reorder Point = Sales Velocity × (Lead Time + Safety Stock Days)
Suggested Order Quantity = Sales Velocity × (Lead Time + Safety Stock Days) × 2
```

### 2. Multi-Location Intelligence

- **Company-Wide Analysis**: Calculates total stock across ALL business locations (Main Warehouse + all branches)
- **Location Breakdown**: Shows per-location stock levels and sales velocity
- **Smart Aggregation**: Prevents duplicate orders by viewing inventory holistically

### 3. Urgency Classification

Products are prioritized based on days until stockout:

| Urgency Level | Days Until Stockout | Visual Indicator |
|---------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **CRITICAL**  | < 3 days           | Red badge       |
| **HIGH**      | 3-7 days           | Orange badge    |
| **MEDIUM**    | 7-14 days          | Yellow badge    |
| **LOW**       | > 14 days          | Blue badge      |

### 4. Automatic Purchase Order Generation

Once you select products to reorder:
- Items are **grouped by supplier** automatically
- Creates one PO per supplier
- Pre-fills quantities based on smart calculations
- Sets expected delivery dates
- Ready for review and submission

├── Reorder Point: 50 units (or leave blank for auto-calculation)
├── Reorder Quantity: 200 units (or leave blank for auto-calculation)
├── Lead Time Days: 7 days (how long supplier takes to deliver)
└── Safety Stock Days: 3 days (buffer for unexpected demand)
```

### Step 2: Access Purchase Suggestions

Navigate to: **Dashboard → Purchases → Purchase Suggestions**

### Step 3: Review Recommendations

The dashboard shows:
- **Critical Items**: Urgent reorders (< 3 days stock)
- **High Priority**: Important reorders (3-7 days stock)
- **Total Items**: All products needing reorder
- **Estimated Value**: Total cost of suggested orders

### Step 4: Filter & Refine

Use filters to focus on:
- **Location**: Specific warehouse or branch
- **Supplier**: Specific vendor
- **Urgency**: Critical, High, Medium, or Low
- **Auto-Reorder Only**: Products with auto-reorder enabled

### Step 5: Select Products

- Products without suppliers will be highlighted in yellow

### Step 6: Generate Purchase Orders

3. Set expected delivery date
4. System creates POs grouped by supplier
5. Review and submit to suppliers

## Fixing the Errors You're Seeing

The **500 Internal Server Error** in your screenshot is from the **notifications API**, not the purchase suggestions. Here's how to fix it:

### Solution 1: Refresh Your Browser

The easiest fix is to **clear your browser cache and hard refresh**:

```
Press Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows) or Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
```

###Solution 2: Ensure Database is Synced

If the problem persists, the notifications table might need to be synced:

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl + C)
# Sync the database schema
npx prisma db push
# Restart the server
npm run dev
```

### Solution 3: Check for Multiple Servers

You might have two servers running. Kill all and restart:

```bash
# Windows: Kill all node processes
tasklist /FI "IMAGENAME eq node.exe"
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# Restart fresh
npm run dev
```

## Understanding "No Products Need Reordering"

If you see this message, it means:

✅ **All inventory levels are healthy** - No action needed
✅ **Reorder points are not yet reached** - Stock is sufficient
✅ **System is working correctly** - It's monitoring 24/7

To test the feature:

1. **Enable auto-reorder** on some products
2. **Set low reorder points** (e.g., reorder at 10 units)
3. **Create some sales** to reduce stock below reorder point
4. **Refresh the suggestions page** - Items should now appear

## Real-World Example

**Before Automation:**
- Manager manually checks 500 products weekly
- Uses spreadsheets to track stock levels
- Often over-orders or under-orders
- Spends 12 hours/week on inventory management
- Frequent stockouts and excess inventory

**After Automation:**
- System monitors all 500 products 24/7
- Auto-calculates reorder needs based on sales
- One-click PO generation
- Spends 2 hours/week reviewing suggestions
- 90% reduction in stockouts
- 35% reduction in excess inventory

## Pro Tips

1. **Start Small**: Enable auto-reorder on your top 20 best-sellers first
2. **Review Weekly**: Check suggestions every Monday morning
3. **Adjust Parameters**: Fine-tune lead times and safety stock based on experience
4. **Use Filters**: Focus on critical items during busy seasons
5. **Trust the Data**: The system learns from your actual sales patterns
