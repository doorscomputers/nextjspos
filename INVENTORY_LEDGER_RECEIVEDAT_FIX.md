## üêõ The Bug - User Report

**User showed screenshot with:**
- Reconciliation Status: **Discrepancy**
- Calculated Balance: 0.00
- System Inventory: 100
- **Variance: -100**
- Message: "No transactions found in the selected period"

**User's Question:**
> "The Inventory Ledger is not right, when I checked the Destination Location it has a variance of Zero and The Total Stock in Zero. Please examine the Report if it is Right, I might be wrong. Thanks!"

### ‚úÖ User Was Correct!

The Inventory Ledger WAS wrong. Transfer TR-202510-0003 HAD been completed successfully (inventory updated to 100 units), but the ledger wasn't showing it!

---

## üîç Root Cause

### Transfer Complete API

**File**: `src/app/api/transfers/[id]/complete/route.ts`

**Before Fix:**
```typescript
const updatedTransfer = await tx.stockTransfer.update({
  where: { id: transferId },
  data: {
    status: 'completed',
    completedBy: parseInt(userId),
    completedAt: new Date(),   // ‚úÖ Set
    verifiedBy: parseInt(userId),
    verifiedAt: new Date(),
    // ‚ùå receivedAt: NOT SET!
  },
})
```

### Inventory Ledger Query

**File**: `src/app/api/reports/inventory-ledger/route.ts`

```typescript
prisma.stockTransfer.findMany({
  where: {
    toLocationId: locId,
    status: { in: ['received', 'completed'] },
    receivedAt: {      // ‚ùå Looking for this field!
      gte: startDate,
      lte: endDate
    },
```

### The Mismatch

1. Complete API sets `completedAt` ‚úÖ
2. But does NOT set `receivedAt` ‚ùå
3. Ledger queries for `receivedAt`
4. **Result**: Transfer not found in ledger!

---

## ‚úÖ The Fix

### 1. Updated Complete API

```typescript
const now = new Date()
const updatedTransfer = await tx.stockTransfer.update({
  where: { id: transferId },
  data: {
    status: 'completed',
    completedBy: parseInt(userId),
    completedAt: now,
    verifiedBy: parseInt(userId),
    verifiedAt: now,
    receivedAt: now,  // ‚úÖ FIXED: Set receivedAt
    verifierNotes: notes || null,
  },
})
```

### 2. Migration Script

**File**: `scripts/fix-transfer-receivedAt.mjs`

**Result:**
```
Found 1 completed transfers with missing receivedAt

‚úÖ Fixed TR-202510-0003 - receivedAt set to 2025-10-20T04:04:31.055Z

‚úÖ SUCCESS: Fixed 1 transfer(s)
```
