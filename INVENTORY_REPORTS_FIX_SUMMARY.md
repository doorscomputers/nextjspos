# Inventory Reports Fix - Complete Summary

## üéØ Issues Fixed

### 1. Inventory Ledger Report Showing No Transactions
**Problem**: The Inventory Ledger report at `/dashboard/reports/inventory-ledger` was not showing beginning inventory transactions for imported products.

**Root Cause**: The report only queried the `StockTransaction` table, but CSV-imported beginning inventory was stored in the `ProductHistory` table.

**Fix Applied**: Updated `src/app/api/reports/inventory-ledger/route.ts` to query both tables:
- Added ProductHistory to the parallel query set
- Added processing loop to include ProductHistory records in the transaction list
- Updated opening balance calculation to include ProductHistory records

### 2. Stock History Page Showing Zero Stock
**Problem**: The Stock History page at `/dashboard/products/[id]/stock-history` was showing zero stock even though products had opening stock (e.g., 8 units for Main Store).

**Root Cause**: The `stock-history.ts` library only queried the `StockTransaction` table, missing ProductHistory records.

**Fix Applied**: Updated `src/lib/stock-history.ts`:
- Modified `getVariationStockHistory()` to query both StockTransaction and ProductHistory tables
- Combined results chronologically
- Added separate processing logic for each source type
- ProductHistory records now correctly update the running balance

### 3. Transaction Type Mismatch
**Problem**: CSV import was creating records with `transactionType: 'beginning_inventory'`, but:
- The TypeScript type `StockTransactionType` only includes `'opening_stock'`
- The Stock History page filters for `'opening_stock'`
- Type mismatch prevented proper display and caused TypeScript warnings

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `src/app/api/products/import-branch-stock/route.ts` to use `'opening_stock'`
- Created migration script to update existing 3,537 ProductHistory records
- All records now use the correct, standardized transaction type

## üìã Files Modified

### 1. `src/app/api/reports/inventory-ledger/route.ts`
**Changes**:
- Added ProductHistory query to parallel queries array
- Added ProductHistory processing loop to build transaction list
- Updated opening balance calculation to include ProductHistory
- Transaction type labels now handle all ProductHistory transaction types

**Lines Modified**: ~80-200

### 2. `src/lib/stock-history.ts`
**Changes**:
- Modified `getVariationStockHistory()` function
- Added ProductHistory query alongside StockTransaction query
- Combined both sources chronologically
- Added conditional processing for each source type
- ProductHistory records calculate running balance incrementally
- StockTransaction records use `balanceQty` directly

**Lines Modified**: ~56-174

### 3. `src/app/api/products/import-branch-stock/route.ts`
**Changes**:
- Changed `transactionType` from `'beginning_inventory'` to `'opening_stock'`
- Updated reason text from "Beginning inventory" to "Opening stock"

**Lines Modified**: 282, 293

### 4. New File: `scripts/fix-transaction-types.mjs`
**Purpose**: Migration script to update existing ProductHistory records
**Outcome**: Updated 3,537 records from `'beginning_inventory'` to `'opening_stock'`

### 5. New File: `scripts/test-reports.mjs`
**Purpose**: Comprehensive test script to verify both reports work correctly
**Verification**: Confirmed reports show opening stock transactions

## üîç How It Works Now

### Inventory Ledger Report
1. Queries 8 different transaction sources in parallel:
   - Purchase Receipts
   - Sales
   - Transfers Out
   - Transfers In
   - Inventory Corrections
   - Purchase Returns
   - Customer Returns
   - **ProductHistory** (NEW)

2. Combines all transactions chronologically

3. Calculates running balance for each transaction

4. Displays complete transaction history with:
   - Opening stock from CSV import
   - All subsequent transactions
   - Accurate running balance

### Stock History Page
1. User selects product variation and location (auto-selected by default)

2. API calls `getVariationStockHistory()` which:
   - Queries both StockTransaction and ProductHistory tables
   - Combines results by date
   - Processes each source appropriately
   - Maintains accurate running balance

3. Page displays:
   - Summary statistics (Quantities In/Out)
   - Current stock (from latest transaction)
   - Stock story narrative
   - Complete transaction timeline
   - Opening stock now visible in table

---

## üìä Transaction Type Standardization

### Before
```typescript
// CSV Import
transactionType: 'beginning_inventory'  // ‚ùå Not in type definition

// Type Definition
export type StockTransactionType =
  | 'opening_stock'
  | 'sale'
  | 'purchase'
  | 'transfer_in'
  | 'transfer_out'
  | 'adjustment'
```

### After
```typescript
// CSV Import
transactionType: 'opening_stock'  // ‚úÖ Matches type definition

// Database (after migration)
- All 3,537 records updated to 'opening_stock'

// Type Definition (unchanged)
export type StockTransactionType =
  | 'opening_stock'  // ‚úÖ Used consistently
  | 'sale'
  | 'purchase'
  | 'transfer_in'
  | 'transfer_out'
  | 'adjustment'
```

## üöÄ What to Test

### 1. Inventory Ledger Report
**URL**: http://localhost:3004/dashboard/reports/inventory-ledger

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to the report
2. Select any product that was imported via CSV
3. Select a location (e.g., Main Store)
4. Choose a date range that includes the import date
5. Click "Generate Report"

**Expected Result**:
- ‚úÖ Opening balance should show correct quantity
- ‚úÖ Transaction list should show "Beginning Inventory" or "Opening Stock" entry
- ‚úÖ Running balance should be accurate
- ‚úÖ No more empty reports for imported products

### 2. Stock History Page
**URL**: http://localhost:3004/dashboard/products/[productId]/stock-history

**Test Steps**:
1. Go to any product detail page
2. Click "Stock History" or navigate to the stock history page
3. Variation and location should auto-select
4. View the stock history table

**Expected Result**:
- ‚úÖ Summary section shows correct "Opening Stock" quantity
- ‚úÖ Current stock displays actual quantity (not zero)
- ‚úÖ Transaction table shows opening stock entry
- ‚úÖ Running balance column shows accurate progression
- ‚úÖ Stock story narrative explains the numbers

### 3. Stock History with Product 786
**Direct Test**:
```bash
node scripts/test-reports.mjs
```

**Expected Output**:
```
üéâ SUCCESS! Both reports should now display beginning inventory!
```

## üîß Technical Details

### Data Flow for Opening Stock

```
CSV Import
    ‚Üì
[Product Created]
    ‚Üì
[Variation Created]
    ‚Üì
[VariationLocationDetails Created] ‚Üê qtyAvailable = 8
    ‚Üì
[ProductHistory Created] ‚Üê transactionType = 'opening_stock'
                          quantityChange = 8
                          balanceQuantity = 8
```

### Report Query Flow

```
Inventory Ledger Report / Stock History Page
    ‚Üì
Query StockTransaction + ProductHistory (in parallel)
    ‚Üì
Combine results chronologically
    ‚Üì
Process each transaction:
  - StockTransaction ‚Üí use balanceQty directly
  - ProductHistory ‚Üí calculate running balance incrementally
    ‚Üì
Display sorted transaction list with running balance
```

### Type Safety

All transaction types are now properly typed as `StockTransactionType`:
- TypeScript enforces valid values
- No runtime errors from invalid types
- IntelliSense suggests correct options
- Compile-time validation

---

## üìù Migration Notes

### For Fresh Imports
- New imports will automatically use `'opening_stock'` transaction type
- No manual migration needed
- Type-safe from the start

### For Existing Data
- Run `node scripts/fix-transaction-types.mjs` to update existing records
- Already executed: 3,537 records updated successfully
- Safe to re-run (idempotent operation)
