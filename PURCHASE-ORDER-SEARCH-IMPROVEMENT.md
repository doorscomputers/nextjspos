# Purchase Order Product Search Improvement

## Overview

The Create Purchase Order page has been enhanced with an intelligent product search system that supports:

1. **Exact SKU/Barcode matching** using EQUALS operator for instant barcode scanning
2. **Fuzzy product name search** using CONTAINS operator for browsing products
3. **Full keyboard navigation** with arrow keys and Enter key selection
4. **Auto-filled default purchase prices** to speed up data entry

---

## Implementation Summary

### 1. New API Endpoint: `/api/products/search`

**File:** `src/app/api/products/search/route.ts`

**Search Logic:**
- **Step 1:** Try exact match on SKU/barcode (case-insensitive EQUALS)
- **Step 2:** If no exact match, perform fuzzy search on product name and variation name (CONTAINS)
- Returns up to 20 results with `matchType` indicator ('exact' or 'fuzzy')

**Query Parameters:**
- `q` - Search query (required)
- `limit` - Maximum results (default: 20)

**Example Requests:**
```bash
# Exact SKU match
GET /api/products/search?q=SKU-12345

# Fuzzy name search
GET /api/products/search?q=laptop
```

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "products": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Dell Laptop",
      "categoryName": "Electronics",
      "variations": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "16GB RAM",
          "sku": "SKU-12345",
          "barcode": "1234567890123",
          "enableSerialNumber": true,
          "defaultPurchasePrice": 800.00,
          "defaultSellingPrice": 1200.00
        }
      ],
      "matchType": "exact"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Testing Guide

### Test Case 1: Exact SKU/Barcode Match

**Scenario:** User scans a barcode or types exact SKU

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to Create Purchase Order page
2. In the product search field, type an exact SKU (e.g., "SKU-12345")
3. Wait for search results (300ms debounce)

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Product appears immediately with "Exact Match" badge
- ✅ Only the specific variation with that SKU is shown
- ✅ matchType = 'exact' in API response

**Test with:**
```
1. Exact SKU: "SKU-12345"
2. Exact barcode: "1234567890123"
3. Mixed case: "sku-12345" (should still match)
```

---

### Test Case 2: Fuzzy Product Name Search

**Scenario:** User searches by product name (partial match)

**Steps:**
1. In the product search field, type partial product name (e.g., "lap")
2. Wait for search results

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ All products with "lap" in their name appear (e.g., "Dell Laptop", "Laptop Bag")
- ✅ All variations under each product are shown
- ✅ matchType = 'fuzzy' in API response

**Test with:**
```
1. Partial name: "lap" → should match "Laptop"
2. Full name: "Dell Laptop" → should match
3. Case insensitive: "LAPTOP" → should match
```

---

### Test Case 3: Keyboard Navigation

**Scenario:** User navigates results with keyboard

**Steps:**
1. Type a search term that returns multiple results (e.g., "laptop")
2. Press `↓` arrow key multiple times
3. Press `↑` arrow key multiple times
4. Press `Enter` on a selected item

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Highlighted item moves down with each `↓` press
- ✅ Highlighted item moves up with each `↑` press

2. Check the added item in the order list

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Unit Cost field auto-populated with default purchase price
- ✅ Subtotal calculated automatically
- ✅ User can still override the price if needed

---

### Test Case 6: Serial Number Warning

**Scenario:** Product requiring serial numbers is added

**Steps:**
1. Search and select a product with `enableSerialNumber: true`
2. Check the added item in the order list

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Search results show "⚠️ Requires Serial" badge
- ✅ Added item displays "⚠️ Requires serial numbers on receipt" warning

---

### Test Case 7: No Results Handling

**Scenario:** Search returns no matches

**Steps:**
1. Type a search term with no matches (e.g., "zzzzzz")
2. Wait for results

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ "No products found" message displayed
- ✅ Helpful hint: "Try searching by SKU, barcode, or product name"
- ✅ No errors in console

---

### Test Case 8: Escape Key Behavior

2. Wait for results to appear
3. Click anywhere outside the search field and dropdown

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Dropdown closes
- ✅ Search term remains in field (not cleared)
- ✅ Clicking back in search field reopens dropdown if results exist

---

### Test Case 10: Duplicate Prevention

**Scenario:** User tries to add the same product twice

**Steps:**
1. Search and add a product
2. Search for the same product again
3. Try to add it

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Warning toast: "Product already in list. Increase quantity if needed."
- ✅ Product is NOT duplicated in the order list
- ✅ User can manually increase quantity in the existing item

---

## Performance Improvements

---

## Security & Permissions

The `/api/products/search` endpoint:

- ✅ Requires authentication (NextAuth session)
- ✅ Checks `PRODUCT_VIEW` permission
- ✅ Filters by `businessId` (multi-tenant isolation)
- ✅ Only returns active products
- ✅ Prevents SQL injection (Prisma ORM)

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Search History** - Remember recent searches per user
2. **Favorites** - Pin frequently ordered products
3. **Suggested Products** - Based on supplier or category
4. **Bulk Barcode Entry** - Paste/scan multiple barcodes at once
5. **Image Thumbnails** - Show product images in results
6. **Stock Levels** - Display current stock in search results
7. **Last Purchase Price** - Show last price paid to this supplier

---

## API Endpoint Details

### Authentication
- **Required:** Yes (NextAuth session)
- **Permission:** `PRODUCT_VIEW`

### Rate Limiting
- **Debounce:** 300ms client-side
- **Recommendation:** Add server-side rate limiting (e.g., 60 requests/minute per user)

### Query Optimization
- Uses Prisma indexes on `businessId`, `sku`, `barcode`, `name`
- Limits results to 20 per query
- Early return on exact match (skips fuzzy search)

### Error Handling
- Returns 401 if not authenticated
- Returns 403 if insufficient permissions
- Returns 500 on database errors
- Empty array if no results (200 OK)

---

## Database Indexes Required

For optimal performance, ensure these indexes exist:

```sql
-- Product table
CREATE INDEX idx_product_business_active ON Product(businessId, isActive);
CREATE INDEX idx_product_name ON Product(name);

-- ProductVariation table
CREATE INDEX idx_variation_sku ON ProductVariation(sku);
CREATE INDEX idx_variation_barcode ON ProductVariation(barcode);
CREATE INDEX idx_variation_name ON ProductVariation(name);
```

Check if indexes exist:
```bash
npx prisma db execute --stdin < check-indexes.sql
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Search is slow
**Solution:**
- Check database indexes (see above)
- Reduce `limit` parameter
- Verify database connection pool size

### Issue: Barcode scanner not working
**Solution:**
- Ensure scanner is in "keyboard emulation" mode
- Scanner should append Enter keycode after barcode
- Test by typing barcode manually + pressing Enter

### Issue: Dropdown not closing
**Solution:**
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify click-outside event listener is attached
- Try pressing Escape key

### Issue: No results for valid product
**Solution:**
- Check product is active (`isActive = true`)
- Verify product belongs to user's business
- Ensure SKU/barcode is exactly correct (no spaces)
- Check user has `PRODUCT_VIEW` permission
