# SUPPLIER RETURN UI FIX SUMMARY

## Issues Found & Fixed

### **Issue 1: "Warehouse" instead of "GRAND TECH" in Customer/Supplier column**

**Root Cause:**
The `stock-history.ts` file was querying BOTH:
1. `supplierReturn` table (correct - has supplier name)
2. `productHistory` table with transactionType = 'supplier_return' (incorrect - has user name)

Both queries returned the same transaction, causing a duplicate entry where the ProductHistory version (showing "Warehouse" from user's name) was displayed instead of the SupplierReturn version (showing "GRAND TECH").

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Added 'supplier_return' to the `notIn` exclusion list in `stock-history.ts` line 223
- Now ProductHistory won't return supplier_return records
- Only the SupplierReturn table data will be used (which has correct supplier name)

**File:** `src/lib/stock-history.ts` line 223

```typescript
// Before:
notIn: ['purchase', 'sale', 'transfer_in', 'transfer_out', 'purchase_return', 'customer_return']

// After:
notIn: ['purchase', 'sale', 'transfer_in', 'transfer_out', 'purchase_return', 'supplier_return', 'customer_return']
```

### **Issue 2: Stock OUT showing 0.00 instead of 1.00**

**Root Cause:**
Same as Issue 1 - the supplier return transaction was being recorded with transactionType = 'supplier_return' in ProductHistory, but the UI summary was filtering for 'purchase_return', so it wasn't being counted.

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Same fix as above - now supplier returns only come from SupplierReturn table
- SupplierReturn table data is processed with type = 'purchase_return' (line 326 of stock-history.ts)
- UI summary filters for 'purchase_return' (line 292 of stock-history page)
- Now they match and the count will be correct!

**File:** `src/lib/stock-history.ts` line 326 (already correct, no change needed)

```typescript
transactions.push({
  date: returnRecord.approvedAt!,
  type: 'purchase_return',  // ← Used by UI filter
  typeLabel: 'Purchase Return',
  referenceNumber: returnRecord.returnNumber,
  quantityAdded: 0,
  quantityRemoved: parseFloat(item.quantity.toString()),
  notes: `Returned to ${returnRecord.supplier.name}`,
  createdBy: returnRecord.supplier.name  // ← This shows in UI!
})
```

## Additional Fixes Applied Earlier

### **Issue 3: Reference Number showing "1" instead of "SR-202510-0001"**

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Updated `stockOperations.ts` to accept and pass `referenceNumber` parameter
- ✅ Modified `processSupplierReturn()` to accept returnNumber, supplierName, returnReason
- ✅ Updated `executeStockUpdate()` to use provided referenceNumber instead of just ID
- ✅ Fixed existing ProductHistory record with script: `fix-product-history-supplier-return.mjs`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/stockOperations.ts`
- `src/app/api/supplier-returns/[id]/approve/route.ts`

## Action Required

### **REFRESH THE PAGE!**

The fixes are now in the code, but your browser still has the old data cached.

**Steps:**
1. **Hard refresh the stock history page:** Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
2. **Verify the fixes:**
   - Customer/Supplier Info should show "**GRAND TECH**" (not "Warehouse")
   - Stock OUT "Total Purchase Return" should show "**1.00**" (not "0.00")
   - Reference No should show "**SR-202510-0001**" (not "1")

---

## Testing Checklist

After refresh, verify:

- [ ] Customer/Supplier information shows "GRAND TECH"
- [ ] Reference Number shows "SR-202510-0001"
- [ ] Total Purchase Return shows "1.00"
- [ ] Stock OUT summary is no longer 0.00
- [ ] Current stock is 21.00 (correct calculation)
- [ ] No duplicate supplier return entries

---

## Prevention

These fixes ensure that future supplier returns will:
1. ✅ Show correct supplier name (not user name)
2. ✅ Show correct reference number (SR-YYYYMM-XXXX)
3. ✅ Be counted in Stock OUT summary
4. ✅ Have complete audit trail with reason
5. ✅ Not create duplicate entries in stock history

---

## Verification Script

Run this to verify the fix worked:

```bash
node verify-supplier-return-display.mjs
```

(Script will check that ProductHistory doesn't have duplicates and SupplierReturn shows correct data)
