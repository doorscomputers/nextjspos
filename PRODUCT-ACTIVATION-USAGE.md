# Product Activation/Deactivation - User Guide

## Quick Start

### What is Product Activation?

Product activation/deactivation allows you to control which products appear in transaction forms (sales, purchases, transfers) **without deleting them**.

### Key Concepts

- **Active Product** ‚úì - Available for all transactions
- **Inactive Product** ‚óã - Hidden from transaction forms but visible in product list
- **Soft Deleted Product** ‚úó - Completely removed from all views

---

## Using the Feature

### 1. View Product Status

Navigate to: **Dashboard ‚Üí Products**

Each product shows a status badge:
- üü¢ **Green "Active"** badge = Product is active
- ‚ö™ **Gray "Inactive"** badge = Product is inactive

Inactive products also have:
- Gray background
- Faded text

---

### 2. Activate/Deactivate a Product

**Requirements:**
- You must have **Product Update** permission
- Typically available to: Super Admin, Admin, Manager

**Steps:**
1. Find the product in the list
2. Look for the toggle switch next to the status badge
3. Click the switch to toggle status
4. Success notification will appear
5. Product status updates immediately

**Toggle Switch Colors:**
- üü¢ Green = Active
- ‚ö™ Gray = Inactive

---

### 3. Filter Products by Status

Use the **filter dropdown** at the top of the products list:

- **All Products** - Shows both active and inactive
- **Active Only** - Shows only active products
- **Inactive Only** - Shows only inactive products

The list updates automatically when you change the filter.

## Common Use Cases

**Problem:** You sell seasonal items (e.g., winter jackets) that you don't want to appear in summer sales.

**Solution:**

2. Products remain in inventory with stock levels intact
3. They won't appear in sales forms
4. Reactivate when season starts again

### Scenario 2: Discontinued Products

**Problem:** Product is discontinued but you still have old stock or historical data.

**Solution:**
1. Deactivate the product
2. Existing stock reports still show inventory
3. Past sales remain in history
4. Product won't appear in new sales
5. When stock is depleted, you can delete it permanently

### Scenario 3: Testing New Products

**Problem:** You want to add a new product but not make it available yet.

**Solution:**
1. Create product as usual (defaults to active)
2. Immediately deactivate it
3. Configure prices, stock, images
4. Activate when ready to sell

### Scenario 4: Bulk Inventory Review

**Problem:** Need to review and clean up old products.

**Solution:**
1. Filter by "Active Only"

## FAQ

**Q: What's the difference between Deactivate and Delete?**

A:
- **Deactivate** = Hide from transactions, keep in system
- **Delete** = Remove completely from system

**Q: Can I deactivate a product with stock?**

A: Yes! Stock levels remain unchanged. The product just won't appear in transaction forms.

**Q: Will deactivating affect my reports?**

A: No. Stock reports, sales history, and analytics still include inactive products.

**Q: Can I reactivate a product later?**

A: Yes! Simply toggle the switch again. Product becomes immediately available.

**Q: What happens to products in my cart when I deactivate them?**

A: This depends on your cart implementation. Best practice: Clear carts or warn users before deactivating.

**Q: Can I set a product to auto-deactivate?**

A: Not currently. This is a potential future enhancement.

**Q: How do I know when a product was deactivated?**

A: Currently, no timestamp is stored. This is a potential future enhancement (activity log).

## Developer Integration

### For Developers Building Transaction Forms

When fetching products for sales, purchase, or transfer forms:

```javascript
// ‚úì CORRECT - Only active products
const response = await fetch('/api/products?forTransaction=true')

// ‚úó WRONG - Includes inactive products
const response = await fetch('/api/products')
```

### API Endpoints

```javascript
// Get all products (with filter)
GET /api/products?active=true     // Active only
GET /api/products?active=false    // Inactive only
GET /api/products                 // All products

// Get products for transactions
GET /api/products?forTransaction=true  // Active only

// Toggle product status
POST /api/products/{id}/toggle-active
```
