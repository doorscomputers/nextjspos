// After sale is completed:
if (saleResponse.ok) {
  const saleData = await saleResponse.json()
  setCompletedSale(saleData)
  setShowReceipt(true)
}

// In JSX:
{showReceipt && completedSale && (
  <SaleReceipt
    sale={completedSale}
    businessInfo={{...}}
    locationInfo={{...}}
    onClose={() => setShowReceipt(false)}
