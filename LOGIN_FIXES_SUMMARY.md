# Login Fixes Summary

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Blank Location Selector on Login Page** ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Location dropdown was empty/blank on login page
- The `/api/locations` endpoint required authentication
- Login page called it BEFORE user was authenticated ‚Üí 401 Unauthorized

**Solution:**
- Created new PUBLIC endpoint: `/api/locations/public/route.ts`
- No authentication required (used on login page)
- Returns all active business locations
- Updated login page to use `/api/locations/public` instead

**Files Changed:**
- ‚úÖ Created: `src/app/api/locations/public/route.ts`
- ‚úÖ Modified: `src/app/login/page.tsx` (line 28)

---

### 2. **Shift Validation Enhancement** ‚úÖ IMPROVED

**Problem:**
- Previous logic checked ALL user's assigned locations for open shifts
- If user was assigned to Locations A, B, and C:
  - If Location A had an open shift by another user
  - User couldn't login ANYWHERE, even at Location B or C
- This was overly restrictive

**Solution:**
- Enhanced shift validation to check ONLY the specific location selected by user
- Now checks: "Does the SELECTED location have an open shift by someone else?"
- Much more precise and allows users to work at their other assigned locations

**Example:**
```
User: JasminKateCashier
Assigned to: Bambang, Main Store

Previous Behavior:
- If Bambang has open shift ‚Üí Can't login anywhere

New Behavior:
- If Bambang has open shift ‚Üí Can't login at Bambang
- But CAN login at Main Store ‚úÖ
```

**Files Changed:**
- ‚úÖ Modified: `src/lib/auth.ts` (lines 80-158)

## üîê Login Validation Flow (Complete)

The complete login validation now works as follows:

### Step 1: Basic Authentication
```
1. Check username exists
2. Check password is correct
3. Check user.allowLogin is true
```

### Step 2: Location Selection
```
4. User selects location from dropdown (REQUIRED)
5. System parses selectedLocationId
```

### Step 3: Shift Validation (Cashiers/Managers Only)
```
6. Check if user has their OWN open shift
   ‚Üí If YES: ALLOW login (they need to close it)

7. Check if SELECTED location has open shift by ANOTHER user
   ‚Üí If YES: BLOCK login with detailed error message
   ‚Üí If NO: Continue
```

**Exemptions:**
- Super Admin
- System Administrator
- Admin
- All Branch Admin

These roles bypass shift validation entirely.

### Step 4: Schedule Validation (if configured)
```
8. Check ScheduleLoginSecurity rules
9. Verify current day/time is allowed
10. If blocked, show schedule restriction message
```

### Step 5: Location Mismatch Detection
```
11. Compare selectedLocation vs assignedLocations
12. If mismatch (and not admin):
    ‚Üí Flag as location mismatch
    ‚Üí Still allow login (non-blocking)
    ‚Üí Send CRITICAL alerts
```

### Step 6: Multi-Channel Notifications
```
13. Send Telegram alert (FREE)
14. Send Email alert (FREE)
15. Send SMS alert (‚Ç±0.70) - only for:
    - Cashier/Manager logins
    - Location mismatches (even admins)
    - SKIPPED for admin logins (cost saving)
```

### Step 7: Audit Logging
```
16. Create AuditLog record with:
    - action: USER_LOGIN
    - userId, username, businessId
    - metadata: { selectedLocation, assignedLocations, isMismatch }
```

### Step 8: Session Creation
```
17. Return JWT token with user data
18. Create NextAuth session
19. Redirect to dashboard
```

## üéØ Key Improvements

### 1. **More Precise Shift Validation**
- ‚úÖ Checks only selected location (not all assigned locations)
- ‚úÖ Allows users to work at other branches if one has conflict
- ‚úÖ Still prevents multiple shifts at same location

### 2. **Public Location Endpoint**
- ‚úÖ No authentication required
- ‚úÖ Works on login page (before user logs in)
- ‚úÖ Returns all active business locations

### 3. **Location-Aware Monitoring**
- ‚úÖ Tracks which location user physically logged in at
- ‚úÖ Detects mismatches between selected vs assigned
- ‚úÖ Sends critical alerts for mismatches

### 4. **Non-Blocking Security**
- ‚úÖ Location mismatch sends alerts but doesn't block login
- ‚úÖ Allows business to monitor and respond
- ‚úÖ Creates audit trail for investigation

## üîß Technical Details

### Variable Scope Optimization
```javascript
// Declared once at top (line 81)
const selectedLocationId = credentials.locationId ? parseInt(credentials.locationId) : null

// Used in shift validation (line 136)
if (selectedLocationId) {
  locationsToCheck = [selectedLocationId]
}

// Used in notifications (line 350)
if (selectedLocationId) {
  const selectedLocation = await prisma.businessLocation.findUnique({
    where: { id: selectedLocationId }
  })
}
```

**Benefits:**
- No duplicate declarations
- Single source of truth
- Efficient parsing (done once)
