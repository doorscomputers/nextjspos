## 🎓 Best Practices

### 1. Review Before Confirming
- Always read the confirmation modal carefully
- Check the product count and location name
- Understand what will happen

### 2. Password Security
- Don't share your password with others
- All destructive operations are traced to YOUR account
- If someone uses your password, it will show YOUR username in audit logs

### 3. Double-Check Removals
- Removing from location deletes ALL inventory records
- Cannot be undone
- Make sure you selected the correct location
- Consider exporting stock data first (if removing large inventory)

### 4. Monitor Audit Logs
- Periodically review audit logs (once viewer page is ready)
- Look for unusual activity
- Verify your own actions were logged correctly
