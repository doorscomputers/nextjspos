# üìö ACCOUNTING MODULE - COMPLETE BEGINNER'S TUTORIAL

**For Users Who Know Nothing About Accounting**

This tutorial will walk you through **EVERY STEP** to set up and test your new accounting system. No accounting knowledge required!

---

## üéØ What We'll Do in This Tutorial

1. ‚úÖ Initialize the Chart of Accounts (create the account structure)
2. ‚úÖ Enter beginning balances (your starting financial position)
3. ‚úÖ Record sample transactions
4. ‚úÖ View and understand each financial report
5. ‚úÖ Verify everything is working correctly

**Time Required**: 20-30 minutes
**What You Need**: Super Admin login credentials

---

## üìù STEP 1: Login and Access Accounting

### 1.1 Login to Your System

```
URL: http://localhost:3000/login
Username: superadmin
Password: password
```

### 1.2 Find the Accounting Menu

After login, look at the left sidebar. You should see:
- Dashboard
- Analytics Dashboard
- POS & Sales
- ... (other menus)
- **üìä Accounting** ‚Üê Look for this!

If you DON'T see "Accounting", it means:
- You don't have `ACCOUNTING_ACCESS` permission
- Only Super Admin has it by default
- Make sure you're logged in as Super Admin

### 1.3 Click on "Accounting"

You should see 4 sub-menus:
- Balance Sheet
- Income Statement
- Trial Balance
- General Ledger

---

## üóÑÔ∏è STEP 2: Initialize Chart of Accounts

**What is Chart of Accounts?**
Think of it as creating folders to organize your money. Each "account" is like a folder where specific types of transactions are stored.

### 2.1 Create the Initialization API Route

First, we need to create an API endpoint to initialize accounts. Create this file:

**File**: `src/app/api/accounting/chart-of-accounts/initialize/route.ts`

```typescript
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { getServerSession } from 'next-auth'
import { authOptions } from '@/lib/auth'
import { hasPermission, PERMISSIONS } from '@/lib/rbac'
import { initializeChartOfAccounts } from '@/lib/chartOfAccounts'

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const session = await getServerSession(authOptions)

    if (!session?.user) {
      return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 })
    }

    if (!hasPermission(session.user, PERMISSIONS.ACCOUNTING_ACCESS)) {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { error: 'You do not have permission to access accounting features' },
        { status: 403 }
      )
    }

    // Check if already initialized
    const existingAccounts = await prisma.chartOfAccounts.count({
      where: { businessId: session.user.businessId }
    })

    if (existingAccounts > 0) {
      return NextResponse.json(
        {
          error: 'Chart of Accounts already initialized',
          message: `Found ${existingAccounts} existing accounts`
        },
        { status: 400 }
      )
    }

    // Initialize Chart of Accounts
    const accounts = await initializeChartOfAccounts(session.user.businessId)

    return NextResponse.json({
      success: true,
      message: `Successfully created ${accounts.length} accounts`,
      data: accounts
    })
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Initialize COA Error:', error)
    return NextResponse.json(
      {
        error: 'Failed to initialize Chart of Accounts',
        details: error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown error',
      },
      { status: 500 }
    )
  }
}
```

### 2.2 Initialize Using API (Postman, Insomnia, or Browser Console)

**Using Browser Console** (easiest way):

1. Open your browser
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
3. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
4. Go to "Console" tab
5. Paste this code:

```javascript
fetch('/api/accounting/chart-of-accounts/initialize', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
})
.then(res => res.json())
.then(data => {
  console.log('‚úÖ Chart of Accounts Initialized!');
  console.log(data);
})
.catch(err => {
  console.error('‚ùå Error:', err);
});
```

6. Press Enter
7. You should see: "‚úÖ Chart of Accounts Initialized!"

**What Just Happened?**
You created 20+ standard accounting accounts:
- **Assets**: Cash, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Equipment
- **Liabilities**: Accounts Payable, Sales Tax Payable
- **Equity**: Owner's Equity, Retained Earnings
- **Revenue**: Sales Revenue, Service Revenue
- **Expenses**: Cost of Goods Sold, Rent, Salaries, Utilities, etc.

---

## üí∞ STEP 3: Enter Beginning Balances

**What are Beginning Balances?**
These are your starting numbers - what you already have before you start using the system.

### 3.1 Gather Your Current Financial Information

Before entering data, you need to know:

**What you OWN (Assets)**:
- üíµ How much cash do you have? (in bank and on hand)
- üè™ What's your inventory worth? (total value of products)
- üë• Does anyone owe you money? (customers who haven't paid)
- üñ•Ô∏è Do you own equipment? (computers, furniture, vehicles)

**What you OWE (Liabilities)**:
- üìã Do you owe suppliers money? (unpaid bills)
- üí≥ Do you have loans? (bank loans, credit lines)
- üèõÔ∏è Do you owe taxes?

**Owner's Investment (Equity)**:
- üíº How much did the owner put into the business?

### 3.2 Example Scenario - Let's Use Real Numbers

Let's say you're starting with:
- **Cash**: $10,000 (in your bank account)
- **Inventory**: $25,000 (value of products in stock)
- **Equipment**: $5,000 (computers, furniture)
- **Accounts Payable**: $8,000 (you owe suppliers)
- **Owner's Equity**: $32,000 (owner's investment)

**Quick Check**: Assets ($40,000) = Liabilities ($8,000) + Equity ($32,000) ‚úÖ

### 3.3 Create Journal Entry API for Beginning Balances

Create this file: `src/app/api/accounting/journal-entries/route.ts`

```typescript
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { getServerSession } from 'next-auth'
import { authOptions } from '@/lib/auth'
import { hasPermission, PERMISSIONS } from '@/lib/rbac'
import { prisma } from '@/lib/prisma'

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const session = await getServerSession(authOptions)

    if (!session?.user) {
      return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 })
    }

    if (!hasPermission(session.user, PERMISSIONS.ACCOUNTING_ACCESS)) {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { error: 'No accounting access' },
        { status: 403 }
      )
    }

    const body = await request.json()
    const { entryDate, description, lines } = body

    // Validate lines balance
    const totalDebits = lines.reduce((sum: number, line: any) => sum + Number(line.debit), 0)
    const totalCredits = lines.reduce((sum: number, line: any) => sum + Number(line.credit), 0)

    if (Math.abs(totalDebits - totalCredits) > 0.01) {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { error: `Entry is not balanced. Debits: ${totalDebits}, Credits: ${totalCredits}` },
        { status: 400 }
      )
    }

    // Get accounts
    const accountCodes = lines.map((line: any) => line.accountCode)
    const accounts = await prisma.chartOfAccounts.findMany({
      where: {
        businessId: session.user.businessId,
        accountCode: { in: accountCodes }
      }
    })

    if (accounts.length !== accountCodes.length) {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { error: 'One or more account codes not found' },
        { status: 400 }
      )
    }

    // Create journal entry
    const entry = await prisma.journalEntry.create({
      data: {
        businessId: session.user.businessId,
        entryDate: new Date(entryDate),
        description,
        status: 'posted',
        balanced: true,
        createdBy: session.user.id,
        lines: {
          create: lines.map((line: any) => {
            const account = accounts.find(a => a.accountCode === line.accountCode)!
            return {
              accountId: account.id,
              debit: Number(line.debit),
              credit: Number(line.credit),
              description: line.description || description
            }
          })
        }
      },
      include: { lines: true }
    })

    return NextResponse.json({
      success: true,
      data: entry
    })
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Journal Entry Error:', error)
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: 'Failed to create journal entry', details: error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown' },
      { status: 500 }
    )
  }
}
```

### 3.4 Enter Beginning Balances Using Browser Console

Open Developer Console (F12) again and run this:

```javascript
// Beginning Balances Entry
fetch('/api/accounting/journal-entries', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    entryDate: '2025-01-01', // Your starting date
    description: 'Beginning Balances - Opening Entry',
    lines: [
      // ASSETS (Debits)
      {
        accountCode: '1000', // Cash
        debit: 10000,
        credit: 0,
        description: 'Cash on hand and in bank'
      },
      {
        accountCode: '1200', // Inventory
        debit: 25000,
        credit: 0,
        description: 'Inventory at cost'
      },
      {
        accountCode: '1500', // Equipment
        debit: 5000,
        credit: 0,
        description: 'Office equipment and furniture'
      },
      // LIABILITIES (Credits)
      {
        accountCode: '2000', // Accounts Payable
        debit: 0,
        credit: 8000,
        description: 'Amount owed to suppliers'
      },
      // EQUITY (Credit)
      {
        accountCode: '3000', // Owner's Equity
        debit: 0,
        credit: 32000,
        description: 'Owner investment and retained earnings'
      }
    ]
  })
})
.then(res => res.json())
.then(data => {
  if (data.success) {
    console.log('‚úÖ Beginning Balances Entered Successfully!');
    console.log(data);
  } else {
    console.error('‚ùå Error:', data.error);
  }

Let's record a sale to see how it affects your financial statements.

### 5.1 Record a Cash Sale

**Scenario**: You sold $1,000 worth of products for cash. The products cost you $600.

```javascript
// Sale Transaction (simplified)
fetch('/api/accounting/journal-entries', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    entryDate: '2025-10-26',
    description: 'Sale #001 - Cash sale',
    lines: [
      // Receive cash
      {
        accountCode: '1000', // Cash
        debit: 1000,
        credit: 0,
        description: 'Cash received from customer'
      },
      // Record revenue
      {
        accountCode: '4000', // Sales Revenue
        debit: 0,
        credit: 1000,
        description: 'Sales revenue'
      },
      // Record cost of goods sold
      {
        accountCode: '5000', // COGS
        debit: 600,
        credit: 0,
        description: 'Cost of products sold'
      },
      // Reduce inventory
      {
        accountCode: '1200', // Inventory
        debit: 0,
        credit: 600,
        description: 'Inventory reduction'
      }
    ]
  })
})
.then(res => res.json())
.then(data => {
  if (data.success) {
    console.log('‚úÖ Sale Recorded!');
  }
});
```

**What Happened?**
- Your **Cash** increased by $1,000
- Your **Inventory** decreased by $600 (what it cost you)

## üè¶ STEP 7: Record an Expense

Let's pay rent to see how expenses affect your reports.

### 7.1 Record Rent Payment

**Scenario**: You paid $2,000 rent for the month.

```javascript
fetch('/api/accounting/journal-entries', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    entryDate: '2025-10-26',
    description: 'Rent payment for October',
    lines: [
      // Record expense
      {
        accountCode: '5100', // Rent Expense
        debit: 2000,
        credit: 0,
        description: 'Monthly rent'
      },
      // Pay cash
      {
        accountCode: '1000', // Cash
        debit: 0,
        credit: 2000,
        description: 'Cash paid for rent'
      }
    ]
  })
})
.then(res => res.json())
.then(data => {
  if (data.success) {
    console.log('‚úÖ Rent Expense Recorded!');
  }
});
```

**What Happened?**
- **Cash** decreased by $2,000
- **Rent Expense** increased by $2,000
- This will reduce your profit

---

## üìä STEP 8: Updated Financial Statements

### 8.1 View Updated Income Statement

Go back to Income Statement and regenerate. Now you should see:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è LOSS! ($1,600)

REVENUE:
  Sales Revenue           $1,000

COGS:
  Cost of Goods Sold        $600

GROSS PROFIT:              $400

OPERATING EXPENSES:
  Rent Expense            $2,000
------------------------
TOTAL EXPENSES:         $2,000

NET INCOME (Loss):      ($1,600)
```

**Interpretation**:
"You had a loss of $1,600. Expenses exceeded revenue. Review your costs and pricing."

**This is NORMAL!** With only one sale and $2,000 rent, you have a loss. As you make more sales, you'll become profitable.

### 8.2 View Updated Balance Sheet

Balance Sheet now shows:
- **Cash**: $9,000 ($10,000 - $2,000 rent + $1,000 sale)
- **Inventory**: $24,400 ($25,000 - $600 sold)
- **Retained Earnings**: Reflects the ($1,600) loss

## üéØ STEP 11: Add More Transactions (Practice)

Now that you understand the basics, try adding more transactions:

### Example 1: Pay a Supplier

```javascript
fetch('/api/accounting/journal-entries', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    entryDate: '2025-10-27',
    description: 'Payment to Supplier ABC',
    lines: [
      {
        accountCode: '2000', // Accounts Payable
        debit: 1000,
        credit: 0,
        description: 'Paid portion of supplier debt'
      },
      {
        accountCode: '1000', // Cash
        debit: 0,
        credit: 1000,
        description: 'Cash paid to supplier'
      }
    ]
  })
})
.then(res => res.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```

### Example 2: Another Sale

```javascript
fetch('/api/accounting/journal-entries', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    entryDate: '2025-10-27',
    description: 'Sale #002 - Credit sale',
    lines: [
      // Customer will pay later (Accounts Receivable)
      {
        accountCode: '1100', // Accounts Receivable
        debit: 2000,
        credit: 0,
        description: 'Customer owes us'
      },
      {
        accountCode: '4000', // Sales Revenue
        debit: 0,
        credit: 2000,
        description: 'Sales revenue'
      },
      {
        accountCode: '5000', // COGS
        debit: 1200,
        credit: 0,
        description: 'Cost of products sold'
      },
      {
        accountCode: '1200', // Inventory
        debit: 0,
        credit: 1200,
        description: 'Inventory reduction'
      }
    ]
  })
})
.then(res => res.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```

## üéì Understanding Your Results

### What's Normal?

**First Month Often Shows Loss**:
- This is NORMAL when starting out
- You have full rent but limited sales
- As sales increase, you'll become profitable

**Balance Sheet Always Balances**:
- Assets ALWAYS equal Liabilities + Equity
- If not balanced, there's an entry error
- Use Trial Balance to find errors

**Cash vs. Profit Are Different**:
- You can have profit but low cash (if customers haven't paid)
- You can have cash but loss (if you took a loan)
- Both reports are important!

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Chart of Accounts already initialized"
**Solution**: That's fine! It means Step 2 is complete. Skip to Step 3.

### "Entry is not balanced"
**Cause**: Total debits don't equal total credits.
**Solution**: Double-check your numbers. Debits must always equal credits.

### "Account code not found"
**Cause**: Using wrong account code or accounts not initialized.
**Solution**:
1. Verify Chart of Accounts is initialized
2. Check account codes (1000=Cash, 1200=Inventory, etc.)

### "Trial Balance shows UNBALANCED"
**Cause**: Error in journal entry.
**Solution**:
1. Review each journal entry
2. Verify debits = credits for each entry
3. Find and correct the error

### "Balance Sheet shows $0 everywhere"
**Cause**: No beginning balances or transactions recorded.
**Solution**: Complete Steps 3, 5, and 7 to add transactions.
