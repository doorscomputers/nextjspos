## ✅ What's Been Built (Phase 2)

### 1. **Period Closing System** (`src/lib/periodClosing.ts`) ✅

**For Non-Accountants - What This Does:**
Period closing is like "balancing your checkbook" at the end of each month. It calculates your profit/loss and prevents accidental changes to past periods.

**Educational Features Included:**
- ✅ Plain English explanations in code comments
- ✅ Step-by-step validation messages
- ✅ Clear error messages explaining what's wrong
- ✅ Success messages showing profit or loss in simple terms

**Functions with Built-in Help:**
```typescript
// Example: Period closing automatically explains results
{
  success: true,
  message: "Period closed successfully. Net income: Profit of 12,500.00"
  // or "Net income: Loss of 3,200.00" if you lost money
}
```

**Validation Messages:**
- ❌ "5 journal entries are still in draft status. Please post or delete them."
- ❌ "3 journal entries are not balanced (debits ≠ credits)"
- ✅ "Period closed successfully!"

---

### 2. **Financial Statement Generator** (`src/lib/financialStatements.ts`) ✅

**For Non-Accountants - What You Get:**

#### **Balance Sheet**
- **Question it answers**: "What does my business own, and what does it owe?"
- **Formula**: Assets = Liabilities + Equity (ALWAYS!)
- **Educational tooltips on EVERY line item**:

```typescript
{
  accountName: 'Cash',
  balance: 15000,
  explanation: 'Money in bank and on hand. This is the most liquid asset - you can spend it immediately.'
}

{
  accountName: 'Accounts Receivable',
  balance: 8500,
  explanation: 'Money customers owe you. You\'ve made the sale but haven\'t received payment yet.'
}

{
  accountName: 'Inventory',
  balance: 45000,
  explanation: 'Value of products available for sale. This will become cash when you sell them.'
}
```

#### **Income Statement (Profit & Loss)**
- **Question it answers**: "Did I make money this period?"
- **Formula**: Profit = Revenue - Expenses
- **Smart status messages**:

```typescript
// If profitable:
explanation: "Congratulations! You made a profit of $10,000. This means your revenue exceeded all your expenses."

// If loss:
explanation: "You had a loss of $3,500. This means your expenses exceeded your revenue. Review your costs and pricing."

// If breakeven:
explanation: "You broke even - revenue equals expenses. No profit or loss."
```

#### **Trial Balance**
- **Question it answers**: "Are my books balanced correctly?"
- **Validation with clear messages**:

```typescript
{
  status: 'balanced',
  message: '✅ Trial Balance is BALANCED! Your books are in good shape.'
}
// or
{
  status: 'unbalanced',
  message: '❌ Trial Balance is UNBALANCED by $150.00. There may be an error in your journal entries.'
}
```

**Built-in Metrics (Automatically Calculated)**:
- Gross Profit Margin (%)
- Operating Margin (%)
- Net Profit Margin (%)
- Current Ratio (can you pay bills?)
- Debt-to-Equity Ratio (how much you owe vs. own)
- Working Capital (money available for operations)

---

### 3. **Complete Accounting Glossary** (`src/lib/accountingGlossary.ts`) ✅

**50+ Terms Explained in Plain English**

Each term includes:
- ✅ **Simple explanation** (one sentence)
- ✅ **Detailed explanation** (paragraph)
- ✅ **Real-world example** (with numbers)
- ✅ **Formula** (if applicable)

**Examples:**

```typescript
ASSETS:
Simple: "Things your business owns that have value"
Detailed: "Assets are resources owned by your business that can provide future economic benefit..."
Example: "Cash in your bank account ($10,000), inventory in your store ($50,000), or a delivery truck ($30,000) are all assets."

NET INCOME:
Simple: "Your profit or loss"
Detailed: "Net Income is the bottom line - what's left after all revenues are collected and all expenses are paid..."
Example: "If you have $50,000 in revenue and $40,000 in expenses, your net income is $10,000 profit."
Formula: "Net Income = Revenue - Expenses"

CURRENT RATIO:
Simple: "Can you pay your bills?"
Detailed: "The current ratio measures your ability to pay short-term obligations. Above 1.0 is good..."
Example: "With $50,000 in current assets and $25,000 in current liabilities, your current ratio is 2.0 - very healthy!"
Formula: "Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities"
```

**Help Messages for Every Report:**
```typescript
HELP_MESSAGES = {
  balanceSheet: {
    title: 'Understanding the Balance Sheet',
    content: `Shows what your business owns, owes, and the owner's stake...

    Think of it like a snapshot of your business's financial health.

    KEY FORMULA: Assets = Liabilities + Equity
    This must ALWAYS be true!`
  },

  incomeStatement: {
    title: 'Understanding the Income Statement',
    content: `Shows whether you made money during a specific period.

    SIMPLE FORMULA: Profit = Revenue - Expenses

    This report helps you understand:
    • Are you making money?
    • Which expenses are too high?
    • Is your pricing profitable?`
  },

  periodClosing: {
    title: 'Understanding Period Closing',
    content: `Period closing is like "balancing your checkbook" at month-end.

    WHAT IT DOES:
    1. Calculates your profit or loss
    2. Updates retained earnings
    3. "Locks" the period (no more changes)
    4. Prepares financial statements

    Once closed, you can only reopen with special permission.`
  }
}
```
