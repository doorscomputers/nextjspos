## ⚠️ WHAT NEEDS TESTING

### UI/API Testing Required

1. **Purchase Flow**
   - Create PO → Receive goods → Approve → Verify stock increase

2. **Sales Flow**
   - Create sale → Process payment → Verify stock decrease

3. **Transfer Flow**
   - Request → Send → Receive → Verify stock moved

4. **Returns**
   - Customer returns (stock increase)
   - Supplier returns (stock decrease)

5. **Corrections**
   - Physical count → Approval → Stock adjustment

6. **Concurrency**
   - 2+ cashiers selling simultaneously
   - Verify no duplicate transactions

## 🚀 QUICK START FOR FURTHER TESTING

### Step 1: Start Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Run Integrity Check
```bash
npm run test:e2e -- inventory-integrity-check.spec.ts
```

### Step 3: Verify Results
Check for:
- ✅ No duplicates
- ✅ Multi-tenant isolation
- ✅ Stock balances correct
