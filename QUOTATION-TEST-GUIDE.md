---

## Test Configuration

**File:** `playwright.config.ts`

```typescript
{
  testDir: './e2e',
  fullyParallel: false,
  workers: 1, // Single worker to prevent conflicts
  timeout: 60000, // 60 seconds per test
  use: {
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
    trace: 'on-first-retry',
    screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
  }
}
```

---

## Key Locators Used

### Search Input
```typescript
page.locator('input[placeholder*="Scan barcode"]')
```

### Product Cards
```typescript
page.locator('.grid > .cursor-pointer')
```

### Cart Items
```typescript
page.locator('.space-y-3 > .border').filter({ hasText: /₱/ })
```

### Buttons
```typescript
page.locator('button:has-text("Save as Quotation")')
page.locator('button:has-text("Save Quotation")').last()
page.locator('button:has-text("View Saved Quotations")')
page.locator('button:has-text("Print")')
```

### Input Fields
```typescript
page.locator('input[placeholder="Enter customer name"]')
page.locator('textarea[placeholder*="Optional notes"]')
```

### Quotation List
```typescript
page.locator('.space-y-2 > .border').filter({ hasText: 'John Doe' })
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Tests timeout at login
**Cause:** Development server not running
**Solution:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Issue 2: Products not found in search
**Cause:** Database not seeded
**Solution:**
```bash
npm run db:push
npm run db:seed
```

### Issue 3: Cashier cannot login
**Cause:** Incorrect credentials or user doesn't exist
**Solution:** Check `prisma/seed.ts` for default credentials

### Issue 4: Print window test fails
**Cause:** Browser popup blocker
**Solution:** Test handles this with:
```typescript
const [newPage] = await Promise.all([
  page.context().waitForEvent('page'),
  printButton.click()
])
```

### Issue 5: Cart not clearing after save
**Cause:** Implementation bug
**Solution:** Verify `handleSaveQuotation` in `pos-v2/page.tsx` has:
```typescript
setCart([])
setSelectedCustomer(null)
```

## Test Data

### Products Used

Tests assume these products exist:

  password: 'password',
  role: 'Cashier'
}
```

### Test Quotation Data

```javascript
{
  customerName: 'John Doe - Test Customer',
  notes: 'Test quotation for Playwright automation',
  items: [
    { productName: 'Generic *', quantity: 1 },
    { productName: '*Mouse*', quantity: 1 }
  ]
}
```

## Debugging Tips

### Enable Verbose Logging

```bash
DEBUG=pw:api npx playwright test e2e/quotation-workflow.spec.ts
```

### Slow Down Test Execution

Add to test file:
```typescript
test.use({ slowMo: 1000 }) // 1 second delay between actions
```

### Pause at Specific Step

```typescript
await page.pause() // Opens Playwright Inspector
```

### Take Screenshot

```typescript
await page.screenshot({ path: 'debug.png', fullPage: true })
```

### Record Video

In `playwright.config.ts`:
```typescript
use: {
  video: 'on', // or 'retain-on-failure'
}
```
