## Detailed Correction Procedures

### Scenario 1: Wrong Location - Transfer Still in Draft

**Status**: Draft
**Stock Impact**: None (no inventory changes yet)
**Difficulty**: ‚≠ê Easy

#### Steps:
1. Go to "All Transfers" page
2. Find your transfer by number (e.g., TR-202510-0001)
3. Click the "View" button
4. Click "Cancel Transfer" button
5. Confirm cancellation
6. Create a new transfer with the correct location

**Why this works**: Draft transfers have no impact on inventory. Cancelling simply marks them as deleted.

**Time Required**: 2-3 minutes

---

### Scenario 2: Wrong Location - Pending Check or Checked

**Status**: Pending Check or Checked
**Stock Impact**: None (no inventory changes yet)
**Difficulty**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê Moderate

#### Steps:
1. **If you have STOCK_TRANSFER_DELETE permission:**
   - Go to transfer detail page
   - Click "Cancel Transfer" button
   - Confirm cancellation
   - Create new transfer with correct location

2. **If you don't have permission:**
   - Contact your supervisor/manager
   - Ask them to cancel the transfer
   - Once cancelled, create new transfer

**Why this works**: These statuses haven't triggered any stock movement yet. Cancellation is clean with no inventory adjustments needed.

**Time Required**: 5-10 minutes

---

### Scenario 3: Wrong Location - In Transit ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

**Status**: In Transit
**Stock Impact**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Stock has been DEDUCTED from source location
**Difficulty**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Complex

#### Understanding the Problem:
When a transfer is marked "In Transit", the system has already:
- ‚úÖ Deducted stock from the source location
- ‚úÖ Marked serial numbers (if any) as "in_transit"
- ‚ùå Stock is NOT yet at the destination

#### Steps:
1. **Stop the physical movement immediately**
   - Contact the driver/courier
   - Prevent goods from reaching wrong location

2. **Cancel the transfer in the system:**
   - Go to transfer detail page
   - Click "Cancel Transfer" (requires STOCK_TRANSFER_DELETE permission)
   - Confirm cancellation
   - **Result**: Stock will be RESTORED to the source location

3. **Verify stock restoration:**
   - Go to "Products" page
   - Check that quantities are back at source location
   - If using serial numbers, verify they're back to "in_stock" status

4. **Create new transfer with correct location:**
   - Create fresh transfer
   - Select CORRECT destination this time
   - Add same items and quantities
   - Submit and follow normal workflow

**Why this is critical**: Cancelling an "In Transit" transfer triggers a stock restoration process. If the goods physically reach the wrong location but the system shows them at the original location, your inventory will be incorrect.

**Time Required**: 15-30 minutes

**Warning**: If goods have already physically arrived at the wrong location, DO NOT cancel. See Scenario 4 instead.

---

### Scenario 4: Wrong Location - Arrived or Later ‚ùå CANNOT CANCEL

**Status**: Arrived, Verifying, Verified, or Completed
**Stock Impact**: üî¥ Stock deducted from source (Arrived/Verifying/Verified) OR fully transferred (Completed)
**Difficulty**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Very Complex

#### Why You Can't Cancel:
Once goods physically arrive at the destination, the transfer workflow assumes:
- Goods are at the destination location (even if stock not added yet)
- Multiple people have confirmed the transfer
- Physical receipt has occurred

Cancelling at this stage would cause inventory discrepancies because:
- System would restore stock to source
- But goods are physically at destination
- Result: Ghost inventory (system shows stock that doesn't physically exist)

#### Solution A: If Transfer is Arrived/Verifying/Verified (Not Yet Completed)

**Contact your system administrator immediately.**

The administrator will need to:
1. Complete the current transfer to the wrong location
2. Create a new transfer from wrong location to correct location
3. Process the second transfer through the workflow

**Example:**
- Original: Main Warehouse ‚Üí Store A (wrong!)
- Should be: Main Warehouse ‚Üí Store B (correct)
- Solution: Complete transfer to Store A, then transfer Store A ‚Üí Store B

#### Solution B: If Transfer is Completed

You have two options:

##### Option B1: Create Reverse Transfer (Recommended)

**Steps:**
1. Complete the original transfer (it's at the wrong location now)
2. Create new transfer: Wrong Location ‚Üí Correct Location
3. Process through complete workflow
4. Stock ends up at correct location

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Complete audit trail
- ‚úÖ All movements documented
- ‚úÖ No inventory discrepancies

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Takes time (full workflow twice)
- ‚ùå Shows "error" in reporting

##### Option B2: Use Stock Adjustment (Last Resort)

**Steps:**
1. Administrator creates Stock Adjustment to deduct from wrong location
2. Administrator creates Stock Adjustment to add to correct location
3. Document the reason thoroughly

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Fast correction

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå No transfer audit trail
- ‚ùå Looks like manual adjustment (red flag in audits)
- ‚ùå Requires admin privileges

**Time Required**: 1-2 hours

## Prevention Tips

### 1. Use the Confirmation Dialog
When creating a transfer, you'll see a confirmation dialog showing:
```
Are you sure you want to transfer X item(s) to:
[DESTINATION LOCATION NAME]
From: [SOURCE LOCATION NAME]
```

**READ THIS CAREFULLY** before clicking "Yes, Create Transfer"

### 2. Double-Check Before Each Stage
Before clicking any workflow buttons:
- ‚úÖ "Submit for Check" - Verify TO location is correct
- ‚úÖ "Approve" - Verify locations match business need
- ‚úÖ "Send Transfer" - FINAL CHECK before stock deduction
- ‚úÖ "Mark as Arrived" - Verify you're at the correct destination
- ‚úÖ "Complete Transfer" - Verify goods match transfer document

### 3. Print Transfer Document
Before sending goods:
1. Print the transfer detail page
2. Attach to physical shipment
3. Destination staff should verify location on document

### 4. Use Notes Field
Add notes like:
- "URGENT: Deliver to Main Store, NOT Warehouse"
- "Destination contact: John Doe - 555-1234"
- "Delivery address: 123 Main St"

### 5. Phone Confirmation
For critical/large transfers:
- Call destination location before sending
- Confirm they're expecting the transfer
- Verify they have space/capacity to receive
