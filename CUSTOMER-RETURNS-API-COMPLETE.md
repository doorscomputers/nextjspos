---

## ✅ API Endpoints - COMPLETE

### 1. **POST /api/customer-returns** - Create Return
**Purpose**: Customer requests to return items from a sale

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "saleId": 123,
  "customerId": 45,
  "locationId": 1,
  "returnDate": "2025-10-07",
  "items": [
    {
      "productId": 10,
      "productVariationId": 25,
      "quantity": 2,
      "unitPrice": 99.99,
      "condition": "resellable",  // resellable, damaged, defective
      "returnType": "refund",      // refund, replacement
      "serialNumberIds": [101, 102],
      "notes": "Customer complaint about quality"
    }
  ],
  "notes": "Customer wants full refund"
}
```

**Business Logic**:
- ✅ Validates items were in original sale
- ✅ Checks return quantity doesn't exceed sale quantity
- ✅ Generates return number (RET-YYYYMM-0001)
- ✅ Calculates total refund amount
- ✅ Sets status to "pending" (awaiting approval)
- ✅ Creates audit log

**Response**:
```json
{
  "return": {
    "id": 1,
    "returnNumber": "RET-202510-0001",
    "status": "pending",
    "totalRefundAmount": 199.98,
    ...
  }
}
```

### 2. **GET /api/customer-returns** - List Returns
**Purpose**: List all returns with filtering

**Query Parameters**:
- `status` - pending, approved, rejected
- `customerId` - Filter by customer
- `saleId` - Filter by original sale
- `startDate` / `endDate` - Date range
- `page` / `limit` - Pagination

**Response**:
```json
{
  "returns": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "total": 50,
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 25,
    "totalPages": 2
  }
}
```

---

### 3. **GET /api/customer-returns/[id]** - Get Return Details
**Purpose**: View individual return with all items

**Response** includes:
- Return information
- Customer details
- Original sale details
- All return items with conditions
- Status and approval info

---

### 4. **POST /api/customer-returns/[id]/approve** - Approve Return ⚡ CRITICAL
**Purpose**: Approve return and restore stock

**This is where the magic happens!**

**Stock Restoration Logic**:
```typescript
For each returned item:

  IF condition === "resellable":
    ✅ ADD quantity back to stock at return location
    ✅ Create positive stock transaction (+quantity)
    ✅ Mark serial numbers as "returned" (available for resale)
    ✅ Set currentLocationId for serial numbers

  ELSE IF condition === "damaged" OR "defective":
    ❌ DO NOT add to stock
    ✅ Create stock transaction with 0 quantity (for tracking)
    ✅ Mark serial numbers as "damaged" or "defective"
    ❌ No currentLocationId (item out of circulation)
```

**What Happens**:
1. **Resellable Items**:
   - Stock quantity ADDED to location
   - Serial numbers marked as "returned"
   - Available for immediate resale
   - Creates `customer_return` stock transaction (positive)

2. **Damaged Items**:
   - Stock NOT restored
   - Serial numbers marked as "damaged"
   - Tracked but not available for sale
   - Creates transaction record (0 quantity)

3. **Defective Items**:
   - Stock NOT restored
   - Serial numbers marked as "defective"
   - Tracked for warranty claims
   - Creates transaction record (0 quantity)

**Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "Customer return approved - stock restored for resellable items",
  "return": {
    "id": 1,
    "status": "approved",
    "approvedBy": 2,
    "approvedAt": "2025-10-07T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

---

### 5. **DELETE /api/customer-returns/[id]** - Reject Return
**Purpose**: Reject pending return request

**Business Rules**:
- Can only reject "pending" returns
- No stock changes occur
- Status changes to "rejected"
- Creates audit log

---

{
  "saleId": 1,
  "locationId": 1,
  "returnDate": "2025-10-07",

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Stock Restoration is CRITICAL**:
   - Only resellable items restore stock
   - Damaged/defective items are tracked but not available for sale
   - Serial numbers follow item condition

2. **Return Validation**:
   - Can only return items that were in the original sale
   - Cannot return more than was sold
   - Return must reference a valid sale

3. **Status Flow**:
   - `pending` → Can be approved or rejected
   - `approved` → Final status (stock restored if applicable)
   - `rejected` → Final status (no stock changes)

4. **Multi-Tenant Isolation**:
   - All queries filtered by businessId
   - Returns only visible to owning business
