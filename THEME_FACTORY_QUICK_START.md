// Example: Sales Dashboard Card
<div className="tf-card-elevated">
  <div className="tf-flex tf-flex-between mb-4">
    <h3 className="tf-heading-3">Total Sales</h3>
    <span className="tf-badge tf-badge-primary">+12%</span>
  </div>
  <p className="tf-heading-1">₱125,430</p>
  <p className="tf-body-sm">vs last month</p>
</div>
```

```tsx
// Combine Theme Factory with Tailwind
<div className="flex items-center gap-4 p-6 tf-card">
  <span className="tf-badge tf-badge-primary">New</span>
  <h3 className="text-xl font-bold">Product Title</h3>
  <button className="tf-btn tf-btn-primary">Add to Cart</button>
</div>

## ⚡ Performance Notes

**Theme Factory is optimized for performance:**

✅ **CSS Variables** - Instant theme switching, no re-rendering
✅ **Zero JS Overhead** - Pure CSS utility classes
✅ **LocalStorage** - User preference persists across sessions
✅ **Lazy Loading** - Only loads when needed
✅ **Small Bundle** - ~15KB of CSS (gzipped: ~3KB)

**Will NOT affect app speed** - CSS is cached by the browser!
