# Location Enable/Disable Feature - Complete Guide

## ‚úÖ Feature Overview

This feature allows administrators to enable or disable business locations. Disabled locations are:
- ‚ùå Hidden from all dropdowns
- ‚ùå Excluded from reports and branch stock lists
- ‚ùå Not available for new transactions
- ‚úÖ Still visible in the admin locations management page
- ‚úÖ Can be re-enabled at any time

---

## üìã What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Change
**File**: `prisma/schema.prisma`

Added `isActive` field to `BusinessLocation` model:
```prisma
model BusinessLocation {
  // ... existing fields ...
  isActive Boolean @default(true) @map("is_active")
  // ... rest of fields ...
}
```

- **Column**: `is_active` (BOOLEAN)
- **Default**: `true` (all new locations are active by default)
- **Migration**: Executed via `scripts/add-location-isactive.mjs`

### 2. API Endpoints

#### a) Updated Locations API (`/api/locations`)
**File**: `src/app/api/locations/route.ts`

**Changes**:
- Added `includeInactive` query parameter
- Filters to show only active locations by default
- Admins can request all locations with `?includeInactive=true`

**Usage**:
```typescript
// Get only active locations (default behavior)
fetch('/api/locations')

// Get all locations including inactive (admin page)
fetch('/api/locations?includeInactive=true')
```

**Result**:
- ‚úÖ All dropdowns automatically show only active locations
- ‚úÖ All reports automatically filter to active locations
- ‚úÖ Admin page can see all locations for management

#### b) New Toggle Status API (`/api/locations/[id]/toggle-status`)
**File**: `src/app/api/locations/[id]/toggle-status/route.ts`

**Method**: `POST`

**Permission Required**: `LOCATION_UPDATE`

**Request**:
```bash
POST /api/locations/1/toggle-status
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Location enabled successfully",
  "location": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Main Store",
    "isActive": true
  }
}
```

**Security**:
- ‚úÖ Requires authentication
- ‚úÖ Requires `LOCATION_UPDATE` permission
- ‚úÖ Multi-tenant isolated (businessId check)
- ‚úÖ Validates location exists

### 3. Admin UI - Locations Page
**File**: `src/app/dashboard/locations/page.tsx`

**New Features**:

#### a) Status Column
- Shows "Active" badge (green) for enabled locations
- Shows "Inactive" badge (gray) for disabled locations
- Visual indicators using `CheckCircleIcon` and `XCircleIcon`

#### b) Enable/Disable Button
- Appears in the Actions column
- Shows "Disable" button for active locations
- Shows "Enable" button for inactive locations
- Only visible to users with `LOCATION_UPDATE` permission
- Confirmation dialog before toggling

#### c) Fetch All Locations
- Admin page uses `?includeInactive=true`
- Shows both active and inactive locations for management
- Allows admins to re-enable disabled locations

## üéØ How It Works

### Default Behavior (For All Dropdowns & Reports)

When components fetch locations via `/api/locations`:

```typescript
// Component code
const response = await fetch('/api/locations')
const data = await response.json()
// data.locations will ONLY contain active locations
```

**API filters automatically**:
```typescript
// In route.ts
if (!includeInactive) {
  baseWhere.isActive = true  // Filters out inactive locations
}
```

**Result**:
- ‚úÖ POS dropdowns only show active locations
- ‚úÖ Transfer forms only show active locations
- ‚úÖ Reports only include active locations
- ‚úÖ Stock pages only list active locations
- ‚ùå No changes needed in existing components!

### Admin Management (Locations Page Only)

```typescript
// Locations page explicitly requests all locations
const response = await fetch('/api/locations?includeInactive=true')
// Shows both active and inactive for management
```

---

## üìñ Usage Guide

### For Admins

#### 1. Disabling a Location

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to `/dashboard/locations`
2. Find the location you want to disable
3. Click the "Disable" button in the Actions column
4. Confirm the action in the dialog

**Confirmation Message**:
```
Disable Main Store? This location will be hidden from dropdowns, reports, and transactions.
```

**Result**:
- Location status changes to "Inactive" (gray badge)
- Location disappears from all dropdowns immediately
- Existing transactions remain untouched
- Historical data is preserved

#### 2. Re-enabling a Location

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to `/dashboard/locations`
2. Find the inactive location (gray "Inactive" badge)
3. Click the "Enable" button in the Actions column
4. Confirm the action in the dialog

**Confirmation Message**:
```
Enable Main Store? This location will become available for transactions.
```

**Result**:
- Location status changes to "Active" (green badge)
- Location appears in all dropdowns immediately
- Can be used for new transactions

## üîß Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Temporarily Closed Location

**Scenario**: Main Store is undergoing renovation and will be closed for 2 weeks.

**Action**: Disable Main Store

**Effect**:
- ‚úÖ Employees can't create new sales for Main Store
- ‚úÖ Transfer requests can't send/receive to Main Store
- ‚úÖ Stock reports exclude Main Store
- ‚úÖ Historical data remains intact
- ‚úÖ Re-enable when renovation is complete

### Use Case 2: Future Location Setup

**Scenario**: Planning to open a new branch next month, want to pre-configure it.

**Action**:
1. Create the new location
2. Immediately disable it
3. Set up initial inventory and users
4. Enable when ready to open

**Effect**:
- ‚úÖ Location exists in the system
- ‚úÖ Inventory can be pre-configured
- ‚úÖ Users can be assigned
- ‚úÖ Doesn't appear in operational dropdowns
- ‚úÖ Enable on opening day

### Use Case 3: Seasonal Location

**Scenario**: Holiday pop-up store operates only during December.

**Action**:
1. Create the location in November
2. Enable in December
3. Disable in January
4. Re-enable next December

**Effect**:
- ‚úÖ Location preserved year-over-year
- ‚úÖ Historical sales data retained
- ‚úÖ Only active during operational period
- ‚úÖ No need to delete and recreate

### Use Case 4: Warehouse vs. Retail Locations

**Scenario**: Want to separate warehouse from retail in POS dropdowns.

**Action**: Disable warehouse locations

**Effect**:
- ‚úÖ Warehouse doesn't appear in POS sales dropdown
- ‚úÖ Warehouse still accessible in inventory transfers
- ‚úÖ (Note: Better to use location-specific user assignments)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details

### Database Migration

**Script**: `scripts/add-location-isactive.mjs`

**SQL Executed**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE business_locations
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true;
```

**Result**:
- ‚úÖ Column added successfully
- ‚úÖ All existing locations defaulted to `active = true`
- ‚úÖ No data loss
- ‚úÖ Backward compatible

### Data Flow

```
User clicks "Disable" button
    ‚Üì
Frontend: handleToggleStatus()
    ‚Üì
API: POST /api/locations/[id]/toggle-status
    ‚Üì
Check LOCATION_UPDATE permission
    ‚Üì
Verify location exists and belongs to user's business
    ‚Üì
Toggle isActive field: true ‚Üí false
    ‚Üì
Return success response
    ‚Üì
Frontend: Refresh locations list
    ‚Üì
Location now shows "Inactive" badge
    ‚Üì
All subsequent API calls to /api/locations exclude this location
```

### Automatic Filtering

All components that fetch locations via `/api/locations` without parameters automatically receive only active locations:

**Before**:
```typescript
const locations = await prisma.businessLocation.findMany({
  where: {
    businessId: parseInt(businessId),
    deletedAt: null
  }
})
// Returns all locations including inactive
```

**After**:
```typescript
const baseWhere = {
  businessId: parseInt(businessId),
  deletedAt: null
}

if (!includeInactive) {
  baseWhere.isActive = true  // Filters out inactive
}

const locations = await prisma.businessLocation.findMany({
  where: baseWhere
})
// Returns only active locations by default
```

## üö® Important Notes

### 1. Existing Transactions Are Not Affected
- Disabling a location does NOT affect historical data
- Past sales, purchases, and transfers remain intact
- Reports can still show historical data for disabled locations

### 2. Users Assigned to Disabled Locations
- Users may still be assigned to disabled locations
- They simply won't see it in operational dropdowns
- Admin can reassign users before disabling location

### 3. Inventory in Disabled Locations
- Stock quantities remain in the database
- Stock is not automatically transferred elsewhere
- Admin should transfer stock before disabling if needed

### 4. Re-enabling a Location
- Fully reversible operation
- All data and settings remain intact
- Location immediately becomes available again

### 5. Deletion vs. Disabling
- **Disable**: Temporary, reversible, preserves all data
- **Delete**: Permanent, soft-delete, removes from active use
- **Recommendation**: Use disable for temporary closures, delete only when truly removing a location
