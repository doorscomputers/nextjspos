## Test Architecture

### Test Phases

| Phase | What It Tests | Duration | Critical? |
|-------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| 1. Purchase Entry | Creating purchase orders with serial numbers | ~10s | Medium |
| 2. GRN Approval | Receiving goods and increasing inventory | ~15s | High |
| 3. Supplier Return | **CRITICAL ACCOUNTING FIX** - AP reduction, payment creation | ~20s | **CRITICAL** |
| 4. Stock Transfers | Moving inventory between 3 locations | ~30s | Medium |
| 5. Return Transfers | Returning inventory to warehouse | ~30s | Medium |
| 6. Sales Transaction | Selling products and reducing inventory | ~15s | Medium |

## Critical Validation: Phase 3 Supplier Return

### The Problem This Fixes

**Before the fix:**
- Supplier returns would reduce inventory ✓
- BUT Accounts Payable was NOT reduced ✗
- AND no Payment record was created ✗
- Result: Balance sheet imbalance, inflated AP, missing audit trail

**After the fix:**
- Supplier returns reduce inventory ✓
- Accounts Payable is reduced ✓
- Payment record is created ✓
- Result: Balanced accounting, proper audit trail

### What Phase 3 Validates

```typescript
// 1. Inventory Reduction
Drawer: -2 units (from 10 to 8)
SSD: -3 units (from 20 to 17)

// 2. Accounts Payable Reduction
Total Return Amount: ₱14,500
AP Before: ₱80,000
AP After: ₱65,500
AP Reduced: ₱14,500 ✓

// 3. Payment Record Creation
Payment Number: PAY-202510-0001
Amount: ₱14,500
Method: "supplier_return_credit"
Status: "completed"
Reference: SR-202510-0001 ✓

// 4. Serial Number Updates
2 serials marked as "supplier_return" ✓
currentLocationId set to null ✓

// 5. Stock Transactions
2 negative stock transactions created ✓
```

### Accounting Integrity Checks

The test performs multiple accounting integrity checks:

1. **Balance Sheet Validation**
   ```typescript
   calculatedTotal = items.sum(quantity × unitCost)
   storedTotal = supplierReturn.totalAmount
   assert(calculatedTotal === storedTotal)
   ```

2. **AP Reduction Verification**
   ```typescript
   apBefore = getTotalAPBalance()
   approveSupplierReturn()
   apAfter = getTotalAPBalance()
   assert(apBefore - apAfter === returnAmount)
   ```

3. **Payment Record Verification**
   ```typescript
   payment = findPayment({
     method: 'supplier_return_credit',
     reference: returnNumber
   })
   assert(payment.amount === returnAmount)
   assert(payment.status === 'completed')
   ```

4. **Inventory Reduction Verification**
   ```typescript
   stockBefore = getStockLevel()
   approveSupplierReturn()
   stockAfter = getStockLevel()
   assert(stockAfter === stockBefore - returnQuantity)
   ```

## Database Verification

The test directly queries the database at each phase to verify:

### Stock Levels
```sql
SELECT
  vld.product_variation_id,
  vld.location_id,
  vld.qty_available
FROM variation_location_details vld
WHERE ...
```

### Accounts Payable
```typescript
const apEntries = await prisma.accountsPayable.findMany({
  where: {
    supplierId: testSupplierId,
    businessId: testBusinessId,
  },
})
const totalBalance = sum(apEntries.map(ap => ap.balanceAmount))
```

### Payment Records
```typescript
const payment = await prisma.payment.findFirst({
  where: {
    paymentMethod: 'supplier_return_credit',
    transactionReference: returnNumber,
  },
})
```

### Serial Numbers
```typescript
const serials = await prisma.productSerialNumber.findMany({
  where: {
    serialNumber: { in: createdSerialNumbers },
  },
})
// Verify status distribution
```

## Test Data Management

### Setup (beforeAll)
- ✓ Find or create test locations
- ✓ Find test products
- ✓ Find or create GRAND TECH supplier
- ✓ Generate unique serial numbers
- ✓ Verify user permissions

### Cleanup (afterAll)
Deletes in reverse dependency order:
1. Sales and sale items
2. Stock transfers and items
3. Supplier returns and items
4. Payment records
5. Purchase receipts and items
6. Purchases and items
7. Serial numbers and movements
8. Stock transactions

**Ensures:** No orphaned test data in database

## Error Handling

### Comprehensive Assertions
- ✓ HTTP status code checks
- ✓ Database record existence
- ✓ Numeric calculations with tolerance
- ✓ String comparisons
- ✓ Boolean verifications
- ✓ Array length checks

### Descriptive Error Messages
```typescript
expect(drawerQtyAfter).toBe(drawerQtyBefore - 2)
// If fails: "Expected 8 to be 8, got 10"
// Clear indication that inventory was not reduced

expect(payment).toBeTruthy()
// If fails: "Payment record not found for supplier_return_credit"
// Clear indication that accounting fix is not working
```

### Screenshots on Failure
All screenshots saved with descriptive names:
- `supplier-return-workflow-01-logged-in.png`
- `supplier-return-workflow-02-purchase-created.png`
- etc.
