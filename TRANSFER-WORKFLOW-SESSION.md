# Stock Transfer Workflow - Implementation Complete
**Session Date:** October 7, 2025
**Critical Requirement:** *"Money is involved here and they might put me to jail if the app has errors"*

---

##  COMPLETED: Full Multi-Stage Approval Workflow

### User Requirements Implemented

**From User:**
> "The receiving branch needs to check and accept the products that they receive if it is the same with the encoded transfer from the Origin. There should be a Printed transfer Receipt with the Header as the Transfering Branch and the Destination, Date and Time, who encoded it and who checked the items before they transfer. It would be better also if the one who checked the transfered items should have an account to access the transfer based on the printed transfer copy so he can check and approve. After the checker approved with his own account, then he can authorize the transfer so that the receiving branch can open it so they can also check the products if it tallies with the printed transferred products. Make sure that once the receiving branch approved that they received the correct products, they will click something like a checkbox that they really received the correct items or products, and once the receiving branch finalize it, then that is the time that inventories of both branches or locations will adjust their own inventories and it cannot be edited anymore."

### Workflow States Implemented

## = Security & Data Integrity

### Stock Management - ZERO TOLERANCE

#### Critical Points Implemented:
1. **Stock Deduction:**
   -  Occurs ONLY at `in_transit` stage (when send is called)
   -  Validates sufficient stock before deduction
   -  Creates negative stock transaction for audit trail
   -  Updates ProductStock balance at origin

2. **Stock Addition:**
   -  Occurs ONLY at `completed` stage (after all items verified)
   -  Creates or updates ProductStock at destination
   -  Creates positive stock transaction for audit trail
   -  Updates ProductStock balance at destination

3. **Stock Restoration (Cancellation):**
   -  Restores stock to origin if cancelled after sending
   -  Creates cancellation stock transaction
   -  Maintains complete audit trail

4. **Atomicity:**
   -  All stock operations wrapped in Prisma `$transaction`
   -  Rollback on any error
   -  No partial updates possible

### Serial Number Lifecycle

```
Origin: in_stock ’ (send) ’ in_transit ’ (complete) ’ in_stock at Destination
                        “
                   (cancel) ’ in_stock at Origin (restored)
```

**Implementation:**
-  Serial numbers marked `in_transit` when transfer sent
-  LocationId remains at origin during transit
-  Serial numbers marked `in_stock` at destination when completed
-  LocationId updated to destination on completion
-  Serial numbers restored to origin on cancellation

### Permission Matrix

| Action | Permission Required | Location Access | Additional Checks |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Create | STOCK_TRANSFER_CREATE | Origin | - |
| Submit | STOCK_TRANSFER_CREATE | - | Creator only |
| Check Approve | STOCK_TRANSFER_CHECK | Origin | Warning if checker = creator |
| Check Reject | STOCK_TRANSFER_CHECK | Origin | Reason required |
| Send | STOCK_TRANSFER_SEND | Origin | Sufficient stock |
| Mark Arrived | STOCK_TRANSFER_RECEIVE | Destination | - |
| Start Verification | STOCK_TRANSFER_VERIFY | Destination | - |
| Verify Item | STOCK_TRANSFER_VERIFY | Destination | - |
| Complete | STOCK_TRANSFER_COMPLETE | Destination | All items verified |
| Cancel | STOCK_TRANSFER_CANCEL | Location-dependent | Cannot cancel completed |

### Immutability Rules

**Completed Transfers:**
-  Cannot be modified
-  Cannot be cancelled
-  Cannot be deleted
-  Stock transactions are permanent
-  Enforced at API level

**Validation:** Every endpoint that modifies a transfer checks:
```typescript
if (transfer.status === 'completed') {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: 'Cannot modify completed transfers - they are immutable' },
    { status: 400 }
  )
}
```

### Audit Trail - Complete Logging

**Every Action Logged:**
-  transfer_create
-  transfer_submit
-  transfer_check_approve
-  transfer_check_reject
-  transfer_send
-  transfer_arrived
-  transfer_verification_start
-  transfer_item_verify
-  transfer_complete
-  transfer_cancel

   - Submit for checking
   - Checker approves
   - Send transfer ’ **Verify stock deducted from origin**
   - Mark arrived
   - Start verification
   - Verify all items with checkboxes
   - Complete transfer ’ **Verify stock added to destination**

   - Cancel after sending ’ **Verify stock restored to origin**
   - Verify cannot cancel completed transfer

4. **Immutability Tests**
   - Attempt to modify completed transfer (should fail)
   - Attempt to cancel completed transfer (should fail)
   - Verify stock cannot be changed after completion

5. **Serial Number Tests**
   - Create transfer with serialized items
   - Verify serial numbers marked in_transit when sent
   - Verify serial numbers moved to destination when completed
   - Verify serial numbers restored to origin when cancelled

6. **Permission Tests**
   - Test each endpoint with insufficient permissions
   - Test location access validation
   - Test checker = creator warning

7. **Audit Trail Tests**
   - Verify all actions logged
   - Verify metadata completeness
   - Verify user tracking correct

## = Critical Reminders

**User's Words:**
> "Money is involved here and they might put me to jail if the app that I will give them has errors and will cost them lots of money."

**Zero Tolerance:**
- Stock accuracy must be 100%
- All transactions must be atomic
- Complete audit trail required
- Immutability after completion enforced
- Comprehensive testing mandatory

**Before Production:**
-  Unit tests for each endpoint
-  Integration tests for complete workflow
-  Stock accuracy validation tests
-  Serial number lifecycle tests
-  Permission enforcement tests
-  Manual verification by user
