# Purchase Suggestions Page - Error Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The **500 Internal Server Error** you saw in the browser console was coming from the **Notifications API**, NOT the Purchase Suggestions feature itself. The notifications API had incorrect data type handling for user IDs and business IDs.

## What Was Fixed

### ✅ Fixed: Notifications API Type Handling

**File:** `src/app/api/notifications/route.ts`

**Changes:**
1. Added proper integer parsing for `userId` and `businessId` in GET requests
2. Fixed integer parsing in POST requests for creating notifications
3. Added null handling for `relatedId` field

**Before:**
```typescript
const where: any = {
  userId: session.user.id,
  businessId: session.user.businessId
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
const where: any = {
  userId: parseInt(session.user.id.toString()),
  businessId: parseInt(session.user.businessId.toString())
}
```

## How to Test the Fix

1. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl + Shift + R to hard refresh)
2. Navigate to **Dashboard → Purchases → Purchase Suggestions**
3. The page should load without errors
4. No more 500 errors in the browser console

## How to Set Up

### Step 1: Enable Auto-Reorder on Products

For products you want to track automatically:

```
Products → Edit Product → Auto-Reorder Tab
├── ✅ Enable Auto-Reorder
├── Reorder Point: 50 (or leave blank for auto)
├── Reorder Quantity: 200 (or leave blank for auto)
├── Lead Time Days: 7 (supplier delivery time)
└── Safety Stock Days: 3 (buffer for unexpected demand)
```

### Step 2: Assign Suppliers to Products

```
Products → Edit Product → Supplier Tab
└── Select Supplier from dropdown
```

### Step 3: Access Purchase Suggestions

```
Dashboard → Purchases → Purchase Suggestions
```

### Step 4: Review and Generate POs

1. Review suggested products
2. Filter by urgency/location/supplier
3. Select products to reorder
4. Click "Generate Purchase Orders"
5. Choose delivery location
6. System creates POs grouped by supplier

## Why "No Products Need Reordering"?

If you see this message, it means:

✅ **Your inventory is healthy** - All stock levels are above reorder points
✅ **System is working correctly** - It's monitoring 24/7
✅ **No action needed right now** - Check back daily or weekly

To test the feature with sample data:

1. Enable auto-reorder on a product
2. Set a very low reorder point (e.g., 10 units)
3. Make sure the product has some sales history
4. Reduce stock below reorder point
5. Refresh the page → Product should appear

## Technical Details

### API Endpoint
```
GET /api/purchases/suggestions

Query Parameters:
- locationId: Filter by location (optional)
- supplierId: Filter by supplier (optional)
- urgency: Filter by urgency level (critical|high|medium|low)
- onlyEnabled: Show only auto-reorder enabled products (true|false)
```

### Database Tables Used
- `products` - Product master data and reorder settings
- `product_variations` - Variants and supplier assignments
- `variation_location_details` - Stock levels per location
- `sale_items` - Sales history (last 30 days)
- `suppliers` - Supplier information
- `business_locations` - Location data

### Algorithm Overview
```
FOR EACH product WITH auto_reorder = true:
  1. Calculate total stock across ALL locations
  2. Analyze sales from last 30 days across ALL locations
  3. Calculate: avg_daily_sales = total_sales ÷ 30
  4. Skip if no sales history (dead stock)
  5. Calculate: reorder_point = avg_daily_sales × (lead_time + safety_stock)
  6. If current_stock < reorder_point:
     - Calculate days_until_stockout = current_stock ÷ avg_daily_sales
     - Determine urgency based on days_until_stockout
     - Calculate suggested_order_qty
     - Add to suggestions list
  7. Sort by urgency and days until stockout
```

## Troubleshooting
