# Per-Location Pricing Feature - Complete Guide

## ‚úÖ Feature Implementation Complete!

The per-location pricing feature has been successfully implemented! Each location can now have its own selling prices for products.

---

## üéØ What's New

### 1. **API Endpoint** ‚úÖ
**URL:** `PUT /api/products/variations/[variationId]/inventory`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "locationId": 1,
  "sellingPrice": 2500.00
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Location selling price updated successfully",
  "inventory": {
    "id": 1,
    "productVariationId": 1,
    "locationId": 1,
    "qtyAvailable": 48,
    "sellingPrice": 2500.00
  }
}
```

**Security:**
- ‚úÖ Requires `PRODUCT_UPDATE` permission
- ‚úÖ Users can only edit prices for their assigned locations
- ‚úÖ Multi-tenant isolation enforced (businessId)
- ‚úÖ Validates price is valid number >= 0

---

### 2. **UI Component** ‚úÖ
**Location:** Product Detail Page (`/dashboard/products/[id]`)

**Features:**
- üìä Table showing all locations with their prices
- ‚úèÔ∏è Inline editing - click the pencil icon to edit
- üíæ Save/Cancel buttons for each edit
- üé® Visual indicators:
  - **Custom** (blue badge) = Location has its own price
  - **Default** (gray badge) = Uses variation's default price
- üìù Helpful guide explaining how it works
- üîí RBAC - Edit button only shows for users with PRODUCT_UPDATE permission

---

### 3. **Import Enhancement** ‚úÖ
**Updated:** `/api/products/import-branch-stock`

**Change:** Now sets `sellingPrice` for each location during import

**Before:**
```typescript
{
  locationId: 1,
  qtyAvailable: 48,
  sellingPrice: null  // ‚ùå Not set
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
{
  locationId: 1,
  qtyAvailable: 48,
  sellingPrice: 2400.00  // ‚úÖ Set from CSV
}
```

**Benefits:**
- All locations start with the same price from the CSV
- Users can then customize prices for specific locations
- Easier to bulk-update via import, then fine-tune manually

---

## üìñ How to Use

### Option 1: Via UI (Recommended)

1. **Navigate to product:**
   - Go to `/dashboard/products`
   - Click on any product
   - Scroll down to "Per-Location Selling Prices" section

2. **Edit a location price:**
   - Find the location you want to edit
   - Click the pencil (‚úèÔ∏è) icon
   - Enter the new price
   - Click the checkmark (‚úì) to save
   - Or click (‚úó) to cancel

3. **Visual feedback:**
   - Custom prices show in **blue** with "Custom" badge
   - Default prices show in gray with "Default" badge
   - Toast notification confirms save

### Option 2: Via API

**Example using cURL:**
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3004/api/products/variations/1/inventory \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "locationId": 2,
    "sellingPrice": 2650.00
  }'
```

**Example using JavaScript:**
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/products/variations/1/inventory', {
  method: 'PUT',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    locationId: 2,
    sellingPrice: 2650.00
  })
})

const data = await response.json()
console.log(data.message) // "Location selling price updated successfully"
```

### Option 3: Via Import

1. **Prepare CSV with prices:**
   ```csv
   Item Code,Item Name,?Cost,?Price,Warehouse,Main Store
   PROD001,Product 1,?100.00,?200.00,50,30
   ```

2. **Import at:**
   http://localhost:3004/dashboard/products/import-branch-stock

3. **Result:**
   - All locations get ‚Ç±200.00 as selling price
   - You can then edit specific locations via UI

---

## üîÑ How It Works

### Price Resolution Logic

When selling a product, the system uses this priority:

1. **Location-Specific Price** (if set)
   - Stored in `variation_location_details.sellingPrice`
   - Takes precedence over default

2. **Default Variation Price** (fallback)
   - Stored in `product_variations.sellingPrice`
   - Used when location price is NULL

**Example:**

| Location | Location Price | Default Price | Effective Price |
|----------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| Warehouse | ‚Ç±2,500.00 | ‚Ç±2,400.00 | **‚Ç±2,500.00** (custom) |
| Main Store | NULL | ‚Ç±2,400.00 | **‚Ç±2,400.00** (default) |
| Bambang | ‚Ç±2,300.00 | ‚Ç±2,400.00 | **‚Ç±2,300.00** (custom) |

---

## üéì Common Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Set Custom Price for Premium Location

**Scenario:** Main Store is in a premium area and can charge more

**Steps:**
1. Open product detail page
2. Find "Main Store" in location prices table
3. Click edit icon
4. Change from ‚Ç±2,400.00 to ‚Ç±2,800.00
5. Save

**Result:** Main Store now sells at ‚Ç±2,800.00 while other locations sell at ‚Ç±2,400.00

---

### Use Case 2: Bulk Import then Fine-Tune

**Scenario:** Import 1,000 products with standard pricing, then adjust specific locations

**Steps:**
1. Import CSV with standard prices (all locations get same price)
2. Identify products that need location-specific pricing
3. Navigate to each product
4. Edit prices for specific locations
5. Save changes

**Result:** Most products use standard pricing, select products have custom location pricing

---

### Use Case 3: Promotional Pricing for One Location

**Scenario:** Run a sale at Bambang location only

**Steps:**
1. Find the product
2. Edit Bambang location price
3. Reduce from ‚Ç±2,400.00 to ‚Ç±1,999.00
4. Save

**Result:** Bambang sells at promotional price, other locations at regular price

## üöÄ Next Steps

### For Your Next Import

Since you mentioned importing a fresh CSV soon, here's what will happen:

1. **Delete all products** (you already know how: `node scripts/reset-products.mjs`)

2. **Import new CSV** at `/dashboard/products/import-branch-stock`
   - All locations will get the price from `?Price` column
   - Each location will have `sellingPrice` explicitly set

3. **Customize as needed**
   - Visit any product detail page
   - Edit location-specific prices via the UI
