  reorderQuantity   Decimal? @map("reorder_quantity") @db.Decimal(22, 4)
  leadTimeDays      Int?     @map("lead_time_days")
  safetyStockDays   Int?     @map("safety_stock_days")

## 📊 Business Logic Verification

### Sales Velocity Calculation ✅
```typescript
// Last 30 days sales
const thirtyDaysAgo = new Date()
thirtyDaysAgo.setDate(thirtyDaysAgo.getDate() - 30)

const salesData = await prisma.salesLine.findMany({
  where: {
    productVariationId: variation.id,
    sale: {
      businessId,
      createdAt: { gte: thirtyDaysAgo },
      status: { in: ['completed', 'final'] },
    },
  },
})

const avgDailySales = totalSalesQty / 30
```

### Reorder Point Calculation ✅
```typescript
const reorderPoint = product.reorderPoint
  ? parseFloat(product.reorderPoint.toString())
  : avgDailySales * (leadTimeDays + safetyStockDays)
```

### Suggested Order Quantity ✅
```typescript
const suggestedOrderQty = product.reorderQuantity
  ? parseFloat(product.reorderQuantity.toString())
  : Math.ceil(avgDailySales * (leadTimeDays + safetyStockDays) * 2)
```

### Days Until Stockout ✅
```typescript
const daysUntilStockout = avgDailySales > 0 ? currentStock / avgDailySales : 999
```

### Urgency Determination ✅
```typescript
let urgencyLevel: 'critical' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'
if (daysUntilStockout < 3) urgencyLevel = 'critical'
else if (daysUntilStockout < 7) urgencyLevel = 'high'
else if (daysUntilStockout < 14) urgencyLevel = 'medium'
else urgencyLevel = 'low'
```

## 💡 Example Scenario

**Scenario:** Generic Mouse is running low

### Input Data:
- Current Stock: 25 units (across all locations)
- Sales Last 30 Days: 465 units
- Lead Time: 7 days
- Safety Stock: 3 days
- Unit Cost: $50.00

### System Calculation:
1. **Average Daily Sales:** 465 ÷ 30 = 15.5 units/day
2. **Reorder Point:** (15.5 × 7) + (15.5 × 3) = 155 units
3. **Check:** 25 < 155 → **REORDER NEEDED** ✅
4. **Suggested Quantity:** 15.5 × (7 + 3) × 2 = 310 units
5. **Days Until Stockout:** 25 ÷ 15.5 = 1.6 days → **CRITICAL** 🔴
6. **Estimated Value:** 310 × $50 = $15,500

### Display in UI:
```
Product: Generic Mouse (PCI-0001)
Category: Computer Peripherals
Supplier: Sample Supplier
Current Stock: 25 (red badge)
Reorder Point: 155
Suggested Qty: 310 (blue, bold)
Avg Daily Sales: 15.5
Days Left: 1.6 (red text)
Est. Value: $15,500.00
Urgency: CRITICAL (red badge)
```
