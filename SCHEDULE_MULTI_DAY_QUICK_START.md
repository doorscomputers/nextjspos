## For Developers

### File Modified
```
src/app/dashboard/schedules/create/page.tsx
```

### Key Changes

**1. State Management**
```typescript
// OLD:
const [dayOfWeek, setDayOfWeek] = useState<number | null>(null)

// NEW:
const [selectedDays, setSelectedDays] = useState<number[]>([])
```

**2. Helper Functions**
```typescript
handleSelectWeekdays()  // Selects Mon-Fri [1,2,3,4,5]
handleSelectWeekend()   // Selects Sat-Sun [0,6]
handleSelectAll()       // Selects all 7 days [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
handleClearAll()        // Deselects all []
handleToggleDay(day)    // Toggles single day
```

**3. Submission Logic**
```typescript
// Loop through selected days
for (const dayOfWeek of selectedDays) {
  // Create one schedule per day
  await fetch('/api/schedules', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ dayOfWeek, ...otherFields })
  })
}

// Show results
if (all successful) { toast.success() }
else if (partial) { toast.warning() }
else { toast.error() }
```

### Testing

**Test Case 1: Single Day**
```typescript
selectedDays = [1] // Monday
Expected: 1 schedule created
Result: ✓ Pass
```

**Test Case 2: Weekdays**
```typescript
selectedDays = [1,2,3,4,5]
Expected: 5 schedules created
Result: ✓ Pass
```

**Test Case 3: All Days**
```typescript
selectedDays = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
Expected: 7 schedules created
Result: ✓ Pass
```

**Test Case 4: No Days**
```typescript
selectedDays = []
Expected: Validation error
Result: ✓ Pass
```

### Build Status
```bash
npm run build
# ✓ Compiled with warnings in 2.3min
# Exit code: 0 (Success)
# No errors in schedules/create/page.tsx
```
