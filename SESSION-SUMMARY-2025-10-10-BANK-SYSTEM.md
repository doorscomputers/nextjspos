**Date**: 2025-10-10
**Duration**: Full implementation session
**Status**: ‚úÖ All Code Complete - Ready for Database Migration

---

## üéØ What Was Accomplished

### User's Original Request:
"Where Will I see the Bank transactions? There is no Menu? also, there should be a Bank CRUD menu to add Savings Account, Cheque account, and a Bank Transactions CRUD to add Opening Balance to Savings and Cheque Account, so that the payment transactions will debit or credit to these accounts and a separate Bank Transactions CRUD to enter DEBIT / CREDIT so that it will be a counter check for external bank transactions because sometimes bank transactions are not accurate"

### ‚úÖ Completed Features:

#### 1. Menu Visibility Fixed
- **Issue**: Banks and Bank Transactions menu items were hidden in collapsed Purchases submenu
- **Fix**: Modified `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` to expand Purchases menu by default
- **Result**: Menu items now immediately visible under Purchases

#### 2. Bank CRUD System
- **Created**: Complete bank account management system
- **Features**:
  - Add Savings Account, Cheque Account, Credit Card
  - Set opening balance with date
  - Edit bank details
  - Activate/deactivate accounts
  - Soft delete (with transaction check)
  - Track current balance automatically

#### 3. Opening Balance Functionality
- **Feature**: When creating bank account, can set opening balance
- **Behavior**: Automatically creates bank transaction with type "opening_balance"
- **Balance**: Sets currentBalance = openingBalance initially

#### 4. Manual Bank Transaction Entry (Debit/Credit)
- **Purpose**: Counter-check for external bank transactions
- **Features**:
  - Select bank account
  - Choose Debit (money out) or Credit (money in)
  - Enter amount, date, reference number
  - Add description for reconciliation
  - Auto-updates bank balance
  - Real-time balance preview

#### 5. Payment Integration
- **Feature**: Payments now automatically link to bank accounts
- **Behavior**:
  - When payment is made, system searches for matching bank account
  - If found, links transaction to bank and updates balance
  - If not found, creates standalone transaction (backward compatible)
- **Support**: Works with Bank Transfer, Savings Account, Cheque, Post-Dated Cheque

#### 6. Bank Account Balances Dashboard
- **Location**: Top of Bank Transactions page
- **Display**: Cards showing each active bank's current balance
- **Visual**: Clean, responsive grid layout

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Database Changes

#### New Table: banks
```sql
CREATE TABLE banks (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  business_id INT NOT NULL,
  bank_name VARCHAR(191) NOT NULL,
  account_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- savings, cheque, credit_card
  account_number VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  opening_balance DECIMAL(22, 4) DEFAULT 0,
  opening_balance_date DATE,
  current_balance DECIMAL(22, 4) DEFAULT 0,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  notes TEXT,
  created_by INT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  deleted_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
  UNIQUE (business_id, account_number),
  INDEX (business_id),
  INDEX (account_type)
);
```

#### Updated Table: bank_transactions

- `manual_credit` - Manual entry (money in)

### Amount Convention
- **Negative amount** = Debit (money out)
- **Positive amount** = Credit (money in)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Action Required

### Windows File Locking Issue

The Prisma schema has been updated, but the database migration cannot be completed automatically due to Windows file locking.

**You must manually run these commands:**

```bash
# Step 1: Stop dev server completely
# Close all terminal windows and VS Code

# Step 2: Generate Prisma Client
npx prisma generate

# Step 3: Push schema to database
npx prisma db push

# Step 4: Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

**If you get "EPERM: operation not permitted" error:**
1. Restart your computer
2. Delete `node_modules/.prisma` folder
3. Run the commands again
