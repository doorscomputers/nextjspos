✅ **Cashier roles updated** - New permissions added
✅ **Automatic filtering implemented** - Location & cashier filtering

## Quick Answer to Your Questions

### 1. Is Recharts or Chart.js installed?
**YES!** Recharts v3.2.1 is already installed in package.json

### 2. Can cashiers see their own reports?
**YES!** Cashiers now have access to:
- ✅ Sales Journal (their own sales only)
- ✅ Sales Per Item (items they sold)
- ✅ Sales Per Cashier (their performance)
- ✅ Sales Analytics (their KPIs)

### 3. Automatically filtered by location?
**YES!** All reports automatically filter to:
- Cashier's assigned location (Main Store for cashiermain)
- Cashier's own sales (userId filtering)
- No manual configuration needed

## Changes Made

### Permissions Added ✅
Run: `node update-cashier-permissions.js`

New permissions added to cashier role:
- sales_report.journal
- sales_report.per_item
- sales_report.per_cashier
- sales_report.analytics

### APIs Updated ✅
Updated with automatic filtering:
- /api/reports/sales-journal
- /api/reports/sales-per-item

Pattern to apply to other reports:
```typescript
// Auto-filter by location
const locationIds = getUserAccessibleLocationIds(user)
where.locationId = { in: locationIds }

// Auto-filter by cashier
if (isCashier && !user.permissions.includes('sell.view')) {
  where.userId = user.id
}
```

## Testing

Login as cashier and navigate to Reports:

1. Username: cashiermain
2. Go to Dashboard → Reports
3. Click Sales Journal
4. You should see ONLY your sales from Main Store
5. Cannot see other cashiers' sales
6. Can filter by date range
7. Can export to CSV

## Files Modified
- src/app/api/reports/sales-journal/route.ts
- src/app/api/reports/sales-per-item/route.ts
- src/lib/rbac.ts (permissions added)
- src/components/Sidebar.tsx (menu items)

## Verification

Run these scripts:
```bash
# Check cashier has correct permissions
node check-cashier-permissions.js

# Update cashier role if needed
node update-cashier-permissions.js
```

Expected result: Cashier should have 7 sales report permissions

## Next Steps

Apply same automatic filtering pattern to:
- Sales Per Cashier API
- Sales Per Location API (restrict to assigned location)
- Sales Analytics API
- Other report APIs

Add Recharts visualizations:
```bash
# Already installed! Just import:
import { LineChart, BarChart, PieChart } from 'recharts'
```
