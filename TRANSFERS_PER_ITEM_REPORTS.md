## 📊 PivotGrid Version - How to Use

### Understanding the Pivot

The PivotGrid is like an Excel Pivot Table - it cross-tabulates data in multiple dimensions.

**Default Layout:**
- **Rows**: Product Name → Variation
- **Columns**: Status
- **Data**: Total Quantity Sent, Total Quantity Received, Transfer Count

### Customizing Your Analysis

**Field Chooser Panel (at top):**
- Shows all available fields grouped by area:
  - 🟦 **Row Fields**: Display vertically on left
  - 🟩 **Column Fields**: Display horizontally on top
  - 🟨 **Data Fields**: Measures shown in cells
  - 🟥 **Filter Fields**: Filter without showing in grid

**Drag and Drop:**
1. Drag field from one area to another
2. Rearrange fields within same area (changes order)
3. Remove field by dragging it out

### Example Analyses

#### 1. **Transfer Flow Analysis** (Which locations send to which)
```
Rows: From Location
Columns: To Location
Data: Total Quantity Sent
```
Result: Matrix showing quantities transferred between each location pair

#### 2. **Time Trend Analysis** (Monthly trends)
```
Rows: Product Name
Columns: Transfer Month
Data: Total Quantity Sent
```
Result: See how transfers vary over months

#### 3. **Status Distribution** (Current status breakdown)
```
Rows: Product Name
Columns: Status
Data: Transfer Count
```
Result: See how many transfers are in each status for each product

#### 4. **User Performance** (Who processes most transfers)
```
Rows: Completed By
Columns: Status
Data: Transfer Count
Filter: Completed By (select specific users)
```
Result: See completion statistics by user

### Grand Totals

- **Row Grand Total**: Right column (sum across all columns)
- **Column Grand Total**: Bottom row (sum across all rows)
- **Overall Grand Total**: Bottom-right corner

### Drill Down

- Click "+" to expand groups
- Click "-" to collapse groups
- Right-click on value to see contributing records

## ✅ DevExtreme License Question

> "I dont have a license yet on Devextreme but I will bear with the Nag Screen message where it says this is an evaluation version, I think there is no effect right? the report will always work but its just displays the trial nag screen by Devextreme correct?"

**YES, you are 100% CORRECT!** ✅

**What happens without a license:**
- ✅ **ALL functionality works perfectly**
- ✅ **ALL features available** (DataGrid, PivotGrid, Export, Filtering, etc.)
- ✅ **No time limit** (works forever)
- ✅ **No feature restrictions**
- ❌ **Watermark displayed** saying "Evaluation version" or "Trial version"

**The watermark appears:**
- Small text overlay on the grid
- Does NOT block any functionality
- Does NOT prevent exports
- Does NOT affect performance

**When you buy a license:**
- ✅ Watermark disappears
- ✅ Everything else stays the same
- Just add your license key to the app

**Bottom line:** Use it as long as you want! The "nag screen" is just a watermark, not a functional limitation.

## 🎯 Menu Location

**Reports → Transfer Reports Section:**
```
├─ Transfers Report
├─ Transfer Trends
├─ Transfers per Item          ← NEW! (DataGrid version)
└─ Transfers per Item (Pivot)  ← NEW! (PivotGrid version)
```
