# üìã HOW TO RUN INVENTORY VERIFICATION TESTS

This guide will help you verify that your inventory system is working correctly.

---

## üéØ What We Fixed

‚úÖ **Updated Inventory Ledger Report** to use the new, faster API route that reads directly from StockTransaction table

**File Changed**: `src/app/dashboard/reports/inventory-ledger/page.tsx` (line 171)

**Change Made**:
```diff
- const response = await fetch(`/api/reports/inventory-ledger?${params}`)
+ const response = await fetch(`/api/reports/inventory-ledger-new?${params}`)
```

## üß™ RUNNING VERIFICATION TESTS

### Option 1: Quick SQL Test (Recommended - 2 minutes)

**Step 1**: Open your MySQL/PostgreSQL client
- **XAMPP users**: Open phpMyAdmin (http://localhost/phpmyadmin)
- **PostgreSQL users**: Open pgAdmin or psql

**Step 2**: Select your database
- Find the database you're using (e.g., `ultimatepos_modern`)
- Click on it to select it

**Step 3**: Open the SQL query tab
- Look for "SQL" tab or "Query" button

**Step 4**: Copy and paste the verification script
- Open `QUICK_VERIFICATION_TEST.sql`
- Copy ALL the contents
- Paste into the SQL query window

**Step 5**: Update your Business ID
- Find this line near the top:
  ```sql
  SET @business_id = 1; -- CHANGE THIS TO YOUR BUSINESS ID!
  ```
- Change `1` to your actual business ID
  - **Don't know your business ID?** Run this first:
    ```sql
    SELECT id, name FROM businesses;
    ```

**Step 6**: Execute the query
- Click "Execute" or "Go" button
- Wait for results (should take 2-5 seconds)

**Step 7**: Review the results

You'll see 5 test sections:

#### ‚úÖ TEST 1: Transaction Types
**Expected**: Should see entries like:
- `opening_stock` - 50+
- `purchase` - 20+
- `sale` - 30+
- `transfer_in` / `transfer_out` - If you've done transfers
- `adjustment` - If you've done corrections

**‚ùå FAIL if**: No transactions at all (means system not being used or bug)

---

#### ‚úÖ TEST 2: Variances (MOST IMPORTANT!)
**Expected**: **ZERO results** or **empty table**

This means ledger balance = system stock for all products ‚úì

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING if**: Shows products with variances

Example of variance:
```
Product Name: iPhone 13     | Location: Main Store
Ledger: 100 | System: 98 | Variance: -2
```

**Action if variances found**:
1. Go to `/dashboard/reports/reconciliation`
2. Click "Refresh"
3. Review the variances
4. For small variances (<5%), click "Auto-Fix"
5. For large variances, investigate before fixing

---

#### ‚úÖ TEST 3: Recent Transactions
**Expected**: Shows last 10 transactions with dates, types, quantities, balances

Example:
```
2025-01-25 10:30 | iPhone 13 | sale | Qty: -1 | Balance: 99
2025-01-25 09:15 | iPhone 13 | purchase | Qty: 10 | Balance: 100
```

**Verify**:
- Dates are recent
- Purchase quantities are positive (+)
- Sale quantities are negative (-)
- Balances make sense

---

#### ‚úÖ TEST 4: Health Summary
**Expected**: All checks show "‚úì PASS"

```
Total Transactions: 250 | ‚úì PASS
Variance Check: 0 products | ‚úì PASS - No variances!
Negative Stock: 0 products | ‚úì PASS - No negative stock
Product History Sync: 250 records | ‚úì PASS
```

**‚ùå FAIL if**:
- Total Transactions = 0 (system not being used)
- Variances > 5 (data integrity issue)
- Negative Stock > 0 (unless you allow it)

---

#### ‚úÖ TEST 5: Transaction Type Coverage
**Expected**: Shows which transaction types have been used

```
opening_stock: ‚úì Found (50) | ‚úì PASS
purchase: ‚úì Found (25) | ‚úì PASS
sale: ‚úì Found (30) | ‚úì PASS
transfer_in: ‚úó Not Found | ‚ö† INFO - No transactions yet
transfer_out: ‚úó Not Found | ‚ö† INFO - No transactions yet
```

**Normal**: Some types may not be found if you haven't used them yet
**Expected**: At minimum, should have `opening_stock` or `purchase` or `sale`

---

### Option 2: Test via Application (5 minutes)

**Test A: Create a Test Sale**

1. Login to your POS system
2. Go to POS/Sales
3. Select any product with stock
4. Note the current stock (e.g., 100 units)
5. Sell 1 unit
6. Complete the sale
7. **Verify**: Stock should now be 99 units
8. Run SQL Test 2 (Variances) - should show ZERO variances

**Test B: Test Inventory Ledger Report** (The one we just fixed!)

1. Go to `/dashboard/reports/inventory-ledger`
2. Select a product that has had transactions
3. Select a location
4. Click "Generate Report"
5. **Verify**:
   - Shows all transactions (purchases, sales, transfers, etc.)
   - Running balance updates correctly
   - Closing balance matches current stock

**Test C: Test Reconciliation**

1. Go to `/dashboard/reports/reconciliation`
2. Click "Refresh"
3. **Expected**: Summary cards show:
   - Total Variances: 0
   - Requires Investigation: 0
   - Auto-Fixable: 0
   - Total Variance Value: ‚Ç±0.00

**Test D: Test Transfer (if you have multiple locations)**

1. Create a stock transfer from Location A to Location B
2. Send the transfer
3. Receive the transfer
4. Run SQL Test 2 (Variances)
5. **Verify**: Still shows ZERO variances

## üìä INTERPRETING RESULTS

### ‚úÖ PERFECT SCORE (All Tests Pass):
```
TEST 1: ‚úì Shows various transaction types
TEST 2: ‚úì ZERO variances
TEST 3: ‚úì Recent transactions visible
TEST 4: ‚úì All health checks PASS
TEST 5: ‚úì Transaction types found
```

**Conclusion**: Your inventory system is **100% BULLETPROOF** üõ°Ô∏è

You can trust:
- All inventory counts
- All reports
- All financial valuations
- All audit trails

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING (Small Issues):
```
TEST 2: Shows 1-5 products with small variances (< 5%)
TEST 4: Variance Check shows "‚ö† WARNING - Small variances"
```

**Action**:
1. Go to `/dashboard/reports/reconciliation`
2. Review the variances
3. Click "Auto-Fix Small Variances"
4. Re-run SQL Test 2
5. Should now show ZERO variances

**Cause**: Usually from rounding or timing issues, not a bug

---

### ‚ùå CRITICAL (Major Issues):
```
TEST 1: No transactions found
TEST 2: Many products with large variances (> 10%)
TEST 4: Multiple checks showing "‚úó FAIL"
```

**Action**:
1. **DO NOT** auto-fix large variances
2. Contact support or review audit logs
3. Investigate each variance manually
4. Check if transactions are being created properly

**Possible Causes**:
- Database not seeded
- System not being used yet
- Code bug (rare - all operations were audited)
- Manual database modifications

---

## üéØ NEXT STEPS AFTER VERIFICATION

### If All Tests Pass ‚úÖ
1. **Deploy to production** with confidence
2. **Monitor** reconciliation report weekly for first month
3. **Train users** on proper inventory procedures
4. **Run verification** monthly as a health check

### If Small Variances Found ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. **Auto-fix** using reconciliation tool
2. **Re-test** to confirm fixed
3. **Monitor** for recurring variances
4. **Investigate** if same products show variances repeatedly

### If Critical Issues Found ‚ùå
1. **Do not auto-fix** large variances
2. **Export** variance report for analysis
3. **Review** audit logs for the affected products
4. **Contact** support with:
   - Variance report
   - Affected product IDs
   - Recent transaction history
   - Any error messages

## üìû SUPPORT

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Audit Logs**:
   - Go to `/dashboard/reports/audit-trail`
   - Filter by product ID
   - Review recent inventory actions

2. **Check Product History**:
   - Run this SQL:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM product_history
     WHERE product_id = YOUR_PRODUCT_ID
     ORDER BY created_at DESC
     LIMIT 20;
     ```

3. **Check Stock Transactions**:
   - Run this SQL:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM stock_transactions
     WHERE product_id = YOUR_PRODUCT_ID
     ORDER BY created_at DESC
     LIMIT 20;
     ```

4. **Review Audit Report**:
   - Open `INVENTORY_BULLETPROOF_AUDIT_REPORT.md`
   - Check specific operation (purchase/sale/transfer)
