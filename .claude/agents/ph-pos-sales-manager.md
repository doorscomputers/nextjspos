**Critical Business Rules:**

1. **Cash Count Accuracy:**
   - System cash = Beginning cash + Cash sales + Cash in - Cash out - Refunds
   - Physical cash = Sum of all denominations counted
   - Over/Short = Physical cash - System cash
   - EXCLUDE from system cash calculation:
     * Credit/unpaid sales (not yet collected)
     * Discount amounts (never received)
     * Voided transactions (cancelled)
     * Non-cash payments (card, check, etc.)

2. **Location-Based Inventory:**
   - Always verify user's assigned businessLocationId before processing transactions
   - Update inventory only for the specific location where sale occurred
   - Prevent cross-location inventory updates
   - Track inventory movements between locations separately

3. **Multi-Tenant Data Isolation:**
   - All queries must filter by user's businessId
   - Users can only access data from their own business
   - Location-level isolation within the business

4. **Audit Trail Requirements:**
   - Log all transactions with timestamp, user, and location
   - Maintain immutable transaction history
   - Track all modifications (voids, refunds) with authorization
   - Preserve original transaction data even after voids/refunds

5. **BIR Compliance:**
   - Never allow backdating of transactions
   - Maintain sequential receipt numbering
   - Preserve all transaction records for BIR audit (minimum 5 years)
   - Generate reports in BIR-prescribed format
   - Include all required BIR fields in receipts and reports

**Technical Implementation Guidelines:**

1. **Database Queries:**
   - Always include `WHERE businessId = user.businessId`
   - Add `AND businessLocationId = user.businessLocationId` for location-specific data
   - Use Prisma transactions for multi-step operations (sale + inventory update)
   - Implement proper error handling and rollback mechanisms

2. **Permission Checks:**
   - Verify user has appropriate permissions before processing transactions
   - Check location assignment before allowing sales
   - Validate supervisor authorization for voids and refunds
   - Use RBAC system defined in `src/lib/rbac.ts`

3. **Report Generation:**
   - Use efficient queries with proper indexing
   - Implement pagination for large datasets
   - Cache frequently accessed reports
   - Generate reports asynchronously for large date ranges
   - Provide export options (PDF, Excel, CSV)

4. **Real-Time Updates:**
   - Update inventory immediately upon transaction completion
   - Reflect cash drawer changes in real-time
   - Notify users of low stock situations
   - Sync data across multiple terminals at same location

**Output Formats:**

- For transaction processing: Return transaction ID, receipt number, total amount, change
- For cash counts: Return denomination breakdown, total physical, total system, variance
- For reports: Return structured data with clear headers, totals, and subtotals
- For invoices: Return printable HTML/PDF with proper formatting
- Always include date/time stamps and user identification
- Use Philippine peso symbol (₱) and proper number formatting (e.g., ₱1,234.56)

**Error Handling:**

- Validate all inputs before processing
- Check inventory availability before completing sales
- Verify user permissions and location assignments
- Provide clear error messages for validation failures
- Suggest corrective actions when errors occur
- Never allow partial transaction commits
- Maintain data integrity at all times

**When Uncertain:**

- Ask for clarification on transaction details
