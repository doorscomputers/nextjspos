# Supplier Tracking for Warranty Returns - Complete Guide

## Overview

This system solves a critical business problem: **How to identify which supplier provided a defective item returned by a customer for warranty**.

### The Problem
When a customer returns a product for warranty:
- The same product may be purchased from multiple suppliers
- Without tracking, you don't know which supplier to return the defective item to
- This causes delays, lost money, and supplier relationship issues

### The Solution
Every serial number is now **linked to its supplier** when goods are received, creating a complete audit trail from supplier → customer → warranty return → supplier.

---

## Database Schema Changes

### ProductSerialNumber Model - New Fields

```prisma
model ProductSerialNumber {
  // ... existing fields ...

  // NEW: Supplier tracking (CRITICAL for warranty returns)
  supplierId Int?      @map("supplier_id")
  supplier   Supplier? @relation(fields: [supplierId], references: [id])

  // ... other fields ...

  @@index([supplierId])  // NEW: Index for fast supplier queries
}
```

### Key Benefits
1. ✅ **Direct link** - Each serial number knows its supplier
2. ✅ **Fast queries** - Find all items from a specific supplier instantly
3. ✅ **Warranty tracking** - Know exactly which supplier to return defective items to
4. ✅ **Quality metrics** - Track defect rates by supplier

---

## How It Works - Complete Workflow

### Step 1: Purchase Order → Goods Receipt
```
1. Create Purchase Order (PO-202501-0001)
   └─ Supplier: ABC Electronics
   └─ Items: 10x iPhone 15 Pro

2. Receive Goods (Create GRN: GRN-202501-0001)
   └─ Scan serial numbers:
      - SN12345 (IMEI: 123456789)
      - SN12346 (IMEI: 123456790)
      - ... (8 more)

3. Approve GRN
   ✅ Inventory updated
   ✅ Serial numbers created with supplier_id = ABC Electronics
   ✅ Stock transactions recorded
```

**Code Implementation** (`src/app/api/purchases/receipts/[id]/approve/route.ts:208`):
```typescript
const serialNumberRecord = await tx.productSerialNumber.create({
  data: {
    businessId: parseInt(businessId),
    productId: item.productId,
    productVariationId: item.productVariationId,
    serialNumber: sn.serialNumber,
    imei: sn.imei || null,
    status: 'in_stock',
    condition: 'new',
    currentLocationId: receipt.locationId,

    // CRITICAL: Link to supplier for warranty tracking
    supplierId: receipt.supplierId,  // ← This is the key!

    purchaseId: receipt.purchaseId,
    purchaseReceiptId: receipt.id,
    purchasedAt: receipt.receiptDate,
    purchaseCost: parseFloat(purchaseItem.unitCost.toString()),
  },
})
```

### Step 2: Sale to Customer
```
1. Customer buys iPhone (Serial: SN12345)
2. Serial number status updated:
   └─ status: 'sold'
   └─ soldAt: 2025-01-15
   └─ soldTo: 'John Doe'
   └─ warranty_start_date: 2025-01-15
   └─ warranty_end_date: 2026-01-15 (1 year)
   └─ supplierId: ABC Electronics (RETAINED!)
```

### Step 3: Customer Returns for Warranty
```
1. Customer returns defective iPhone (Serial: SN12345)
   └─ Issue: "Screen not working"

2. Staff creates Warranty Claim (WC-202501-0001)
   └─ Serial Number: SN12345
   └─ Issue: Screen not working
   └─ Claim Type: supplier_warranty

3. System checks warranty validity:
   └─ Is under warranty? YES (expires 2026-01-15)
   └─ Supplier? ABC Electronics (from serial number!)
```

### Step 4: Auto-Generate Supplier Return
```
1. Call API: POST /api/warranty-claims/{id}/create-supplier-return

2. System automatically:
   ✅ Finds supplier from serial number (ABC Electronics)
   ✅ Creates Supplier Return (SR-202501-0001)
   ✅ Links warranty claim to return
   ✅ Updates serial number status to 'warranty_return'
   ✅ Updates warranty claim status to 'returned_to_supplier'

3. Result:
   └─ Supplier Return created automatically
   └─ Correct supplier identified (ABC Electronics)
   └─ No manual lookup needed!
```

   - Return Number: SR-202501-0001
   - Ready to ship back to supplier

### Scenario 2: Batch Recall from Supplier

**Problem:** Supplier ABC Electronics recalls all iPhone 15 Pro from batch B12345 due to battery issue.

**Solution:**

```typescript
// Find all serial numbers from this supplier
const affectedItems = await prisma.productSerialNumber.findMany({
  where: {
    businessId,
    supplierId: 5, // ABC Electronics
    status: 'sold', // Already sold to customers
    // Optional: filter by batch if tracked
  },
  include: {
    sale: true,
  }
})

// Notify all affected customers
// Create supplier returns for recalled items
```

### Scenario 3: Supplier Quality Report

**Goal:** Generate report showing defect rate by supplier

```typescript
// Warranty returns by supplier (last 6 months)
const defectsBySupplier = await prisma.productSerialNumber.groupBy({
  by: ['supplierId'],
  where: {
    businessId,
    status: 'warranty_return',
    createdAt: {
      gte: sixMonthsAgo,
      lte: new Date(),
    },
  },
  _count: { id: true },
  _sum: { purchaseCost: true },
})

// Total purchases by supplier
const totalBySupplier = await prisma.productSerialNumber.groupBy({
  by: ['supplierId'],
  where: {
    businessId,
    createdAt: {
      gte: sixMonthsAgo,
      lte: new Date(),
    },
  },
  _count: { id: true },
})

// Calculate defect rate
const qualityReport = defectsBySupplier.map(defect => ({
  supplierId: defect.supplierId,
  defectCount: defect._count.id,
  totalPurchased: totalBySupplier.find(t => t.supplierId === defect.supplierId)?._count.id || 0,
  defectRate: (defect._count.id / totalPurchased) * 100,
  totalLoss: defect._sum.purchaseCost,
}))
```

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Data

If you have existing serial numbers without supplier information, use this script:

```sql
-- Backfill supplier_id for existing serial numbers
-- Links serial numbers to suppliers via purchase receipts

UPDATE product_serial_numbers psn
SET supplier_id = pr.supplier_id
FROM purchase_receipts pr
WHERE psn.purchase_receipt_id = pr.id
  AND psn.supplier_id IS NULL;

-- Verification query
SELECT
  psn.serial_number,
  p.name as product_name,
  s.name as supplier_name,
  pr.receipt_number,
  psn.warranty_end_date,
  psn.status
FROM product_serial_numbers psn
LEFT JOIN suppliers s ON psn.supplier_id = s.id
LEFT JOIN products p ON psn.product_id = p.id
LEFT JOIN purchase_receipts pr ON psn.purchase_receipt_id = pr.id
WHERE psn.status = 'sold'
  AND psn.warranty_end_date >= CURRENT_DATE
ORDER BY psn.created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Testing the Implementation

```bash
# 1. Create a test purchase order
POST /api/purchases
{
  "supplierId": 5,
  "items": [...]
}

# 2. Create GRN with serial numbers
POST /api/purchases/receipts
{
  "purchaseId": 123,
  "items": [
    {
      "productVariationId": 45,
      "quantityReceived": 1,
      "serialNumbers": [
        {
          "serialNumber": "TEST-SN-001",
          "imei": "123456789",
          "condition": "new"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

# 3. Approve GRN (this links supplier to serial number)
POST /api/purchases/receipts/123/approve

# 4. Verify supplier is linked
GET /api/serial-numbers/TEST-SN-001/supplier
# Should return supplier info!

# 5. Create warranty claim
POST /api/warranty-claims
{
  "serialNumber": "TEST-SN-001",
  "issueDescription": "Test defect",
  "claimType": "supplier_warranty"
}

# 6. Auto-create supplier return
POST /api/warranty-claims/{claimId}/create-supplier-return
# Should automatically create return to correct supplier!
```

## Reports You Can Build

### 1. Supplier Quality Dashboard
```typescript
// Top 10 suppliers by defect rate
SELECT
  s.name as supplier_name,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN psn.status = 'warranty_return' THEN 1 END) as defect_count,
  COUNT(*) as total_units,
  ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN psn.status = 'warranty_return' THEN 1 END)::numeric / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) as defect_rate_percent,
  SUM(CASE WHEN psn.status = 'warranty_return' THEN psn.purchase_cost ELSE 0 END) as total_loss
FROM product_serial_numbers psn
JOIN suppliers s ON psn.supplier_id = s.id
WHERE psn.business_id = 1
  AND psn.created_at >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY s.id, s.name
ORDER BY defect_rate_percent DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 2. Warranty Return Trend by Supplier
```typescript
// Monthly warranty returns by supplier
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('month', psn.created_at) as month,
  s.name as supplier_name,
  COUNT(*) as warranty_returns,
  SUM(psn.purchase_cost) as total_cost
FROM product_serial_numbers psn
JOIN suppliers s ON psn.supplier_id = s.id
WHERE psn.status = 'warranty_return'
  AND psn.business_id = 1
GROUP BY month, s.name
ORDER BY month DESC, warranty_returns DESC;
```

### 3. Items Still Under Warranty by Supplier
```typescript
// Active warranty items by supplier (potential liability)
SELECT
  s.name as supplier_name,
  COUNT(*) as items_under_warranty,
  SUM(psn.purchase_cost) as potential_liability,
  MIN(psn.warranty_end_date) as earliest_expiry,
  MAX(psn.warranty_end_date) as latest_expiry
FROM product_serial_numbers psn
JOIN suppliers s ON psn.supplier_id = s.id
WHERE psn.status = 'sold'
  AND psn.warranty_end_date >= CURRENT_DATE
  AND psn.business_id = 1
GROUP BY s.id, s.name
ORDER BY potential_liability DESC;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Serial number has no supplier
**Cause:** Item was added before supplier tracking was implemented

**Solution:**
1. Check purchase receipt manually
2. Update serial number:
   ```sql
   UPDATE product_serial_numbers
   SET supplier_id = {correct_supplier_id}
   WHERE serial_number = 'XXXX';
   ```

### Issue: Wrong supplier linked to serial number
**Cause:** Data entry error during GRN approval

**Solution:**
1. Verify correct supplier from purchase order
2. Update serial number:
   ```sql
   UPDATE product_serial_numbers
   SET supplier_id = {correct_supplier_id}
   WHERE serial_number = 'XXXX';
   ```
3. Create audit log for the correction

### Issue: Can't create supplier return
**Cause:** Multiple possible reasons

**Check:**
1. Is warranty claim approved/rejected?
2. Does serial number exist?
3. Does serial number have supplier_id?
4. Has return already been created?

---

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Batch/Lot Tracking (Recommended)
Add batch tracking for better traceability:
```prisma
model PurchaseBatch {
  id                Int
  supplierId        Int
  batchNumber       String
  manufactureDate   DateTime?
  expiryDate        DateTime?
  serialNumbers     ProductSerialNumber[]
}
```

### 2. Supplier Portal
Allow suppliers to:
- View warranty claims for their items
- Accept/reject warranty returns
- Track quality metrics

### 3. Automated Email Notifications
- Notify supplier when warranty return is created
- Include serial number, issue description, photos
- Track supplier response time

### 4. Quality Score Automation
- Auto-calculate supplier quality score (1-10)
- Consider: defect rate, response time, resolution rate
- Use for procurement decisions
