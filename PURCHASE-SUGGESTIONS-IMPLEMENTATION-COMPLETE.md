## 🎯 Urgency Levels

The system calculates urgency based on **days until stockout**:

### **CRITICAL** (Red Badge) 🔴
- **< 3 days until stockout**
- **Order immediately**
- High risk of stockout causing lost sales

### **HIGH** (Orange Badge) 🟠
- **3-7 days until stockout**
- **Order today**
- Need to reorder soon to prevent stockout

### **MEDIUM** (Yellow Badge) 🟡
- **7-14 days until stockout**
- **Order this week**
- Should plan reorder within a few days

### **LOW** (Blue Badge) 🔵
- **> 14 days until stockout**
- **Order when convenient**
- No immediate urgency

---

## 💡 How It Works

### **Step 1: Sales Analysis** (Company-Wide)
```
Total Sales (30 days) from ALL Locations
÷ 30 days
= Average Daily Sales
```

### **Step 2: Reorder Point Calculation**
```
If reorderPoint is set manually:
  Use manual value
Else:
  reorderPoint = avgDailySales × (leadTimeDays + safetyStockDays)
```

### **Step 3: Suggested Order Quantity**
```
If reorderQuantity is set manually:
  Use manual value
Else:
  suggestedOrderQty = avgDailySales × (leadTimeDays + safetyStockDays) × 2
```

### **Step 4: Days Until Stockout**
```
daysUntilStockout = currentStock ÷ avgDailySales
```

### **Step 5: Urgency Assignment**
```
If daysUntilStockout < 3  → CRITICAL
If daysUntilStockout < 7  → HIGH
If daysUntilStockout < 14 → MEDIUM
Else                       → LOW
```

## 📊 Example Scenario

### **Product: Generic Mouse**
- **Current Stock (Company-Wide):** 8 units
- **Sales Last 30 Days:** 60 units
- **Average Daily Sales:** 2 units/day
- **Lead Time:** 7 days
- **Safety Stock:** 3 days
- **Reorder Point:** 2 × (7 + 3) = 20 units
- **Suggested Order Qty:** 2 × (7 + 3) × 2 = 40 units
- **Days Until Stockout:** 8 ÷ 2 = 4 days
- **Urgency:** HIGH (3-7 days)

**Result:** Product appears in suggestions as HIGH priority, suggesting an order of 40 units.

## 🛡️ Why These Filters?

### **Why Exclude Products with Zero Sales?**

**Business Logic:** Products with **zero sales in 30+ days** AND **zero stock** are likely:
- Obsolete or discontinued items
- Slow-moving items being phased out
- Products no longer stocked
- Items with no demand

**Solution:** These products should NOT be automatically reordered. Instead:
1. Review why they have no sales
2. Decide if they should be discontinued
3. Manually reorder if needed (not automatic)
4. Mark as inactive if no longer selling

### **Why Exclude Non-Inventory Products?**

**Business Logic:** Products marked with `enableStock: false` are:
- Services (labor, consulting, etc.)
- Fees (service fees, delivery charges)
- Digital products
- Items that don't require inventory tracking

**Solution:** These should NOT appear in purchase suggestions because they don't need physical restocking.

### **Why Exclude Inactive Products?**

**Business Logic:** Products marked as `isActive: false` are:
- Temporarily unavailable
- Seasonal items out of season
- Discontinued products
- Products being phased out

**Solution:** These should NOT be reordered automatically. Reactivate the product first if you want to resume ordering.
