## Multi-Tenant Architecture

All new models follow the existing multi-tenant pattern:
- Every model has `businessId` for data isolation
- Proper indexes on `businessId` for query performance
- Cascading deletes where appropriate (business deletion)
- Restrict deletes for critical references

## Database Indexes

Optimized indexes added for:
- Business ID filtering (multi-tenancy)
- Status-based queries
- Date range queries
- Employee/technician lookups
- Product/variation searches
- Customer searches
- Payment tracking

## Workflow Integration

### Warranty Claim Workflow
1. **Pending** - Claim created by user
2. **Accepted** - Accepted by technical service employee
3. **Under Inspection** - Technical inspection in progress
4. **Diagnosed** - Diagnosis complete with cost estimate
5. **Approved/Rejected** - Management decision
6. **Job Order Created** - Repair job order generated
7. **Completed/Cancelled** - Final resolution

### Repair Job Order Workflow
1. **Pending** - Job order created
2. **In Progress** - Technician working on repair
3. **Parts Ordered** - Waiting for parts
4. **Awaiting Parts** - Parts on order
5. **Completed** - Repair finished
6. **Cancelled** - Job cancelled
7. **On Hold** - Temporarily paused
8. **Customer Approved** - Customer approved the repair
9. **Ready for Pickup** - Ready for customer collection

## Permission Integration

The system is ready for RBAC integration. Suggested permissions to add to `src/lib/rbac.ts`:

- Technician performance comparison
- Warranty claim trends by product/category
- Repair turnaround time analysis

### Use Charts for:
- Warranty claim status distribution (Pie Chart)
- Monthly service revenue (Bar Chart)
- Technician workload visualization (Bar Chart)
- Average repair time trends (Line Chart)

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Data Creation Flow
```typescript
// 1. Create technical service employee
const employee = await prisma.technicalServiceEmployee.create({
  data: {
    businessId: 1,
    employeeCode: "TECH-001",
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    position: "Senior Technician",
    email: "john.doe@example.com",
    mobile: "+1234567890"
  }
});

// 2. Create technician profile
const technician = await prisma.serviceTechnician.create({
  data: {
    businessId: 1,
    employeeId: employee.id,
    primarySpecialization: "Mobile Phone Repair",
    maxConcurrentJobs: 5
  }
});

// 3. Create service type
const serviceType = await prisma.repairServiceType.create({
  data: {
    businessId: 1,
    code: "SCREEN-REPAIR",
    name: "Screen Replacement",
    category: "Hardware Repair",
    standardPrice: 150.00,
    laborCostPerHour: 50.00,
    estimatedHours: 1.5,
    warrantyPeriodDays: 30
  }
});

// 4. Create warranty claim
const claim = await prisma.serviceWarrantyClaim.create({
  data: {
    businessId: 1,
    locationId: 1,
    claimNumber: "WC-2025-0001",
    claimDate: new Date(),
    serialNumberId: 1, // Link to existing ProductSerialNumber
    customerId: 1,
    problemDescription: "Screen cracked after drop",
    warrantyType: "manufacturer",
    isUnderWarranty: true,
    status: "pending",
    createdBy: 1
  }
});

// 5. Create repair job order
const jobOrder = await prisma.repairJobOrder.create({
  data: {
    businessId: 1,
    locationId: 1,
    jobOrderNumber: "JO-2025-0001",
    jobOrderDate: new Date(),
    warrantyClaimId: claim.id,
    serviceTypeId: serviceType.id,
    productId: 1,
    productVariationId: 1,
    customerId: 1,
    customerName: "Jane Smith",
    customerPhone: "+1234567890",
    problemDescription: "Screen cracked",
    technicianId: employee.id,
    priority: "normal",
    laborCost: 75.00,
    partsCost: 120.00,
    totalCost: 195.00,
    status: "pending"
  }
});
```

### 2. Query Examples
```typescript
// Get all pending warranty claims
const pendingClaims = await prisma.serviceWarrantyClaim.findMany({
  where: {
    businessId: 1,
    status: "pending"
  },
  include: {
    customer: true,
    serialNumber: true,
    location: true,
    createdByUser: true
  }
});

// Get technician workload
const technicianWorkload = await prisma.serviceTechnician.findMany({
  where: {
    businessId: 1,
    isAvailable: true
  },
  include: {
    employee: true,
    repairJobOrders: {
      where: {
        status: {
          in: ["pending", "in_progress"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
});

// Get job order with parts
const jobOrderDetails = await prisma.repairJobOrder.findUnique({
  where: { id: 1 },
  include: {
    serviceType: true,
    product: true,
    productVariation: true,
    customer: true,
    technician: {
      include: {
        employee: true
      }
    },
    jobOrderParts: {
      include: {
        product: true,
        productVariation: true
      }
    },
    repairPayments: true
  }
});
```

## Success Criteria

- [x] 7 new models created
- [x] Relations added to 8 existing models
- [x] Multi-tenant architecture maintained
- [x] Proper indexes configured
- [x] Schema validated (Prisma generate)
- [x] Database synchronized (db:push)
- [x] No duplication of ProductSerialNumber model
- [x] Workflow status tracking implemented
- [x] Cost and payment tracking configured
- [x] Documentation created

## Notes

1. **ProductSerialNumber Model:** The existing ProductSerialNumber model was REUSED (not duplicated) as requested. The new ServiceWarrantyClaim model links to it via `serialNumberId`.

2. **Multi-Tenant Support:** All models include `businessId` and respect the existing multi-tenant architecture.

3. **Cascading Deletes:** Properly configured to maintain data integrity while allowing cleanup when business is deleted.

4. **Performance:** Indexes added for common query patterns (status, dates, business ID, etc.).

5. **Flexibility:** The system supports both warranty-based repairs (linked to claims) and direct repair orders (no warranty claim).

6. **Extensibility:** The schema is designed to be extended with additional features like:
   - Service contracts
   - Extended warranty packages
   - Parts inventory management
   - Customer satisfaction surveys
   - Technician scheduling

## Implementation Complete

The Technical Service & Warranty Management System schema is now fully implemented and ready for UI development. All database tables have been created, relations configured, and the system is integrated with the existing multi-tenant architecture.

Next step: Begin UI implementation starting with Technical Service Employee Management.
