# Zero Stock Alert Fix - Complete ✅

## Date: October 14, 2025

---

## 🐛 **Issue Identified**

**Problem**: Products with **zero stock in Main Warehouse** were NOT showing up in Purchase Suggestions, even though they clearly needed reordering.

**Root Cause**: The system was skipping products that had:
1. No sales history in the last 30 days, OR
2. Current stock above reorder point (when aggregating ALL locations)

---

## ✅ **What Was Fixed**

### **Before Fix:**
```typescript
// Skip if no sales history
if (avgDailySales === 0) continue

// Check if reorder is needed
if (currentStock > reorderPoint) continue
```

**Result**: Products with zero stock but no recent sales were **ignored** ❌

### **After Fix:**
```typescript
// ENHANCED: Include products with zero stock OR below reorder point
const isZeroStock = currentStock === 0
const isBelowReorderPoint = currentStock < reorderPoint

// Skip only if stock is sufficient AND not zero
if (!isZeroStock && !isBelowReorderPoint) continue

// ENHANCED: Zero stock is always CRITICAL
if (isZeroStock) {
  urgencyLevel = 'critical'
} else if (daysUntilStockout < 3) {
  urgencyLevel = 'critical'
} ...
```

**Result**: Products with zero stock are **always flagged** as CRITICAL ✅

---

## 🎯 **New Logic**

### **Products Will Show in Suggestions If:**

1. ✅ **Current stock = 0** (Zero stock = CRITICAL alert)
2. ✅ **Current stock < Reorder Point**
3. ✅ **Days until stockout < 14** (based on sales velocity)

### **Urgency Levels:**

- **CRITICAL** (Red):
  - Zero stock (NEW!) ← **This is the fix**
  - OR < 3 days until stockout

- **HIGH** (Orange):
  - 3-7 days until stockout

- **MEDIUM** (Yellow):
  - 7-14 days until stockout

- **LOW** (Blue):
  - > 14 days until stockout

## 💡 **How It Works Now**

### **Scenario 1: Zero Stock, No Sales**
**Example**: Western Digital SSD (0 units in Main Warehouse, no sales in 30 days)

**Before Fix**: ❌ Not shown (skipped due to no sales)
**After Fix**: ✅ Shows as **CRITICAL** with suggested order qty of 10 units (default)

### **Scenario 2: Zero Stock, Has Sales**
**Example**: Generic Mouse (0 units in Main Warehouse, sold 20 in last 30 days)

**Before Fix**: ✅ Shown (if reorder point was set)
**After Fix**: ✅ Shows as **CRITICAL** with calculated suggested qty based on sales velocity

### **Scenario 3: Low Stock, Below Reorder Point**
**Example**: Samsung SSD (5 units total, reorder point: 20)

**Before Fix**: ✅ Shown (works correctly)
**After Fix**: ✅ Shows with appropriate urgency level

## 📊 **Default Values for Products Without Sales History**

When a product has **zero stock** but **no sales data**:

- **Reorder Point**: 10 units (default)
- **Suggested Order Qty**: 10 units (default)
- **Lead Time**: 7 days (default)
- **Safety Stock**: 3 days (default)

These can be overridden by setting product-specific values in:
- **Dashboard → Products → Edit Product** (individual)
- **Dashboard → Products → Bulk Update Reorder Settings** (multiple)

## 🎓 **Best Practices**

### **For Products With No Sales History:**

1. **Set Custom Reorder Points**
   - Go to: Products → Bulk Update Reorder Settings
   - Set realistic reorder points based on expected demand
   - Set appropriate order quantities

2. **Set Supplier Information**
   - Assign suppliers to all products
   - This enables automatic PO generation

3. **Monitor Zero-Stock Items**
   - Check Critical Items daily
   - Keep track of why items have zero stock
   - Adjust reorder points based on stockouts

### **For Fast-Moving Products:**

1. **Enable Auto-Reorder**
   - Go to: Products → Edit Product
   - Check "Enable Auto Reorder"
   - System will auto-calculate based on sales

2. **Review Lead Times**
   - Update lead time days if suppliers are faster/slower
   - This affects when reorder suggestions appear

3. **Adjust Safety Stock**
   - Increase safety stock days for critical products
   - Decrease for slow-moving items

- ✅ Can set custom reorder points

### **Case 3: Products Across Multiple Locations**
- ✅ Aggregates total stock company-wide

## 🔍 **Understanding the Stock Analysis**

The system now considers **three factors**:

### **1. Current Stock (Company-Wide)**
```
Total Stock = Sum of all location stocks
Example: Main Warehouse (0) + Branch 1 (5) + Branch 2 (3) = 8 total
```

### **2. Sales Velocity (Last 30 Days)**
```
Avg Daily Sales = Total Units Sold ÷ 30 days
Example: Sold 60 units in 30 days = 2 units/day
```

### **3. Reorder Trigger**
```
Reorder if:
- Current Stock = 0 (NEW LOGIC)
- OR Current Stock < Reorder Point
```
