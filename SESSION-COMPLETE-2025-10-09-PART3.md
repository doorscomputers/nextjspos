### 3. **Serial Number Tracking System - DESIGN COMPLETE** 📋

**What Was Requested:**
> "how to monitor items returned by customers that are defective... record all the serial numbers of each products purchased in the Purchase Entry form, this way, when a customer complains about the item and it is really defective then the company will know where to return the item to a certain supplier"

**What Was Designed:**

**Complete 5-Phase System:**

**Phase 1: Purchase Receipt - Record Serial Numbers**
- Add serial number entry to GRN creation
- Track Serial Number, IMEI, Condition per unit
- Validate: serial numbers count = quantity received
- Store in `PurchaseReceiptItem.serialNumbers` (JSON)

**Phase 2: Inventory Tracking - Link to Supplier**
- Create new `SerialNumberInventory` table
- Track each serial number individually
- Store supplier ID for traceability
- Track status: in_stock, sold, returned, defective, etc.

**Phase 3: Sales - Link Serial Number to Customer**
- Serial number selection during sale
- Update status to "sold"
- Link to customer and sale

**Phase 4: Customer Returns - Trace Back to Supplier**
- Enter returned serial number
- System automatically displays original supplier
- Record return reason
- Update status to "defective"

**Phase 5: Supplier Returns - Process Returns**
- Group defective items by supplier
- Generate Supplier Return Notes
- Track supplier credits/replacements

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Complete traceability from purchase to return
- ✅ Automatic supplier identification for defectives
- ✅ Status tracking through lifecycle
- ✅ Warranty management capability
- ✅ Supplier performance analytics
- ✅ Financial tracking per serial number

**Schema Designed:**
- New `SerialNumberInventory` model (complete with all relations)
- Unique constraints and indexes
- Status tracking fields
- Traceability fields (supplier, purchase, sale, return)

**UI Mockups Included:**
- GRN serial number entry form
- Sale serial number selection modal
- Customer return serial lookup
- Supplier return grouping

**Documentation:** `SERIAL-NUMBER-TRACKING-DESIGN.md` (comprehensive 350+ lines)

**Implementation Timeline:** 6 weeks (phased approach)

**Status:** 📋 **READY FOR APPROVAL & IMPLEMENTATION**
