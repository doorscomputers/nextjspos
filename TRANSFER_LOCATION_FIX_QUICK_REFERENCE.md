# Transfer Location Fix - Quick Reference Guide

## What Was Fixed?

Users with `ACCESS_ALL_LOCATIONS` permission were getting the wrong default "From Location" in stock transfers (first alphabetically instead of their assigned location).

## Solution in 30 Seconds

The `/api/user-locations` endpoint now:
1. Queries UserLocation table FIRST
2. Returns locations with `isAssigned` flag
3. Sorts assigned locations FIRST
4. Returns `primaryLocationId` field

## Using the New API Response

### Before (Old Code)

```typescript
const response = await fetch('/api/user-locations')
const data = await response.json()

const firstLocation = data.locations[0] // ‚ùå Could be wrong!
setFromLocationId(firstLocation.id)
```

### After (New Code)

```typescript
const response = await fetch('/api/user-locations')
const data = await response.json()

// Use primaryLocationId for correct default
const defaultLocationId = data.primaryLocationId
  ? data.primaryLocationId.toString()
  : data.locations[0].id.toString()

setFromLocationId(defaultLocationId)

// Show visual indicator for assigned locations
{location.isAssigned && (
  <span className="badge">Assigned</span>
)}
```

## API Response Structure

```typescript
interface UserLocationsResponse {
  locations: Array<{
    id: number
    name: string
    isAssigned: boolean  // ‚ú® NEW
  }>
  hasAccessToAll: boolean
  primaryLocationId: number | null  // ‚ú® NEW
}
```

## Testing the Fix

```bash
# Run comprehensive test
node test-transfer-location-fix.mjs

# Expected output: ‚úÖ TEST PASSED
```

## Edge Cases

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| User has ACCESS_ALL_LOCATIONS + assignments | Returns all locations, assigned ones first, primaryLocationId set |
| User has ACCESS_ALL_LOCATIONS, no assignments | Returns all locations alphabetically, primaryLocationId is null |
| User has specific assignments only | Returns only assigned locations, all marked isAssigned: true |
| User has no assignments at all | Returns empty array, shows warning |

## Visual Indicators

The transfer creation page now shows:
- üéØ Green "Assigned" badge on user's home location
- Toast notification: "From Location set to: Main Warehouse (Your Assigned Location)"
- Help text: "Auto-assigned: This is automatically set to your primary assigned location"

## Key Files

- `src/app/api/user-locations/route.ts` - API logic
- `src/app/dashboard/transfers/create/page.tsx` - Frontend implementation

## Common Issues

### Issue: User still gets wrong location

**Solution**: Check if user is assigned in UserLocation table:

```sql
SELECT u.username, bl.name as location_name
FROM users u
JOIN user_locations ul ON u.id = ul.user_id
JOIN business_locations bl ON ul.location_id = bl.id
WHERE u.username = 'warehouse_super';
```

### Issue: No locations showing

**Solution**: Assign user to a location:

```sql
INSERT INTO user_locations (user_id, location_id, created_at)
VALUES (
  (SELECT id FROM users WHERE username = 'warehouse_super'),
  (SELECT id FROM business_locations WHERE name = 'Main Warehouse'),
  NOW()
);
```

## Best Practices

1. ‚úÖ Always use `primaryLocationId` for default selection
2. ‚úÖ Show `isAssigned` badge in UI for clarity
3. ‚úÖ Handle null `primaryLocationId` gracefully
4. ‚úÖ Log location selection in console for debugging
5. ‚úÖ Provide clear user feedback via toast messages

## Performance Notes

- Additional UserLocation query: ~1-5ms
- In-memory sorting: negligible
- No caching needed for typical use cases
- Scales well up to 100+ locations
