# Sales/POS Module Implementation

## ✅ Completed: Sales API Endpoints

### Date: 2025-10-06

## Files Created

### 1. `src/app/api/sales/route.ts` - Main Sales API
**Lines**: 500+ lines
**Features**:
- **GET** - List all sales with filtering
  - Supports SELL_VIEW (all sales) and SELL_VIEW_OWN (own sales only)
  - Filters: status, customerId, locationId, date range
  - Pagination support
  - Includes customer, items, serial numbers, payments

- **POST** - Create new sale
  - ✅ Stock validation (prevents selling zero inventory)
  - ✅ Serial number selection and validation
  - ✅ Serial number count must match quantity
  - ✅ Serial numbers must be in_stock at current location
  - ✅ Payment total must match sale total
  - ✅ Auto-generates invoice numbers: `INV-YYYYMM-XXXX`
  - ✅ Stock deduction in atomic transaction
  - ✅ Serial number status updated to 'sold'
  - ✅ Movement records created (**CRITICAL**: Using actual serialNumberRecord.id)
  - ✅ Complete audit trail
  - ✅ RBAC permission checking
  - ✅ Location access verification

### 2. `src/app/api/sales/[id]/route.ts` - Individual Sale Operations
**Lines**: 300+ lines
**Features**:
- **GET** - Get single sale with full details
  - Includes customer, items, serial numbers, payments
  - Respects SELL_VIEW and SELL_VIEW_OWN permissions

- **PUT** - Update sale (limited)
  - Only notes and status can be updated
  - Cannot modify items, quantities, or amounts after creation
  - Complete audit trail

- **DELETE** - Void sale and restore stock
  - Cannot void sales older than 30 days (business rule)
  - ✅ Restores stock quantities in atomic transaction
  - ✅ Restores serial numbers to 'in_stock' status
  - ✅ Creates movement records for returns
  - ✅ Creates stock transactions for audit
  - ✅ Complete audit trail
  - Status changed to 'voided'

### 3. Updated `src/lib/auditLog.ts`
**Added Actions**:
```typescript
SALE_CREATE = 'sale_create',
SALE_UPDATE = 'sale_update',
SALE_DELETE = 'sale_delete',
```

## Key Features

### 1. Inventory Validation
- ✅ Checks stock availability before sale
- ✅ Prevents selling items with zero inventory
- ✅ Validates serial numbers exist and are available
- ✅ Serial numbers must be at the current location
- ✅ Serial numbers must have status = 'in_stock'

### 2. Serial Number Tracking
- ✅ Validates serial number count matches quantity
- ✅ Prevents duplicate serial number selection
- ✅ Updates serial number status to 'sold'
- ✅ Links serial numbers to sale
- ✅ Tracks customer who purchased (soldTo field)
- ✅ Records sale date (soldAt field)
- ✅ Creates movement records (**BUG FIX APPLIED**: Uses actual ID)

### 3. Payment Processing
- ✅ Supports multiple payment methods
- ✅ Validates payment total matches sale total
- ✅ Records payment method and reference
- ✅ Links payments to sale

### 4. Stock Management
- ✅ Deducts stock immediately on sale
- ✅ Creates stock transaction records
- ✅ Updates variationLocationDetails
- ✅ Atomic transaction (all or nothing)
- ✅ Restores stock on void/delete

### 5. Audit Trail
- ✅ Complete metadata logged
- ✅ WHO: userId, username
- ✅ WHEN: timestamp
- ✅ WHAT: action, description
- ✅ WHERE: IP address, user agent
- ✅ WHY: Included in description and metadata

### 6. RBAC Integration
- ✅ SELL_VIEW: View all sales
- ✅ SELL_VIEW_OWN: View only own sales
- ✅ SELL_CREATE: Create new sales
- ✅ SELL_UPDATE: Update sales
- ✅ SELL_DELETE: Void sales
- ✅ ACCESS_ALL_LOCATIONS: Access all locations
- ✅ Location-based access control

### 7. Business Rules
- ✅ Cannot void sales older than 30 days
- ✅ Cannot modify items/amounts after creation
- ✅ Payment total must match sale total
- ✅ Serial numbers required if product requires them
- ✅ Invoice numbers auto-generated with sequence

## Critical Bug Prevention

**Serial Number Movement Linking**:
```typescript
// CORRECT (Applied in this implementation)
const serialNumberRecord = await tx.productSerialNumber.update({ /* ... */ })
await tx.serialNumberMovement.create({
  data: {
    serialNumberId: serialNumberRecord.id, // ✅ Actual ID
    // ...
  }
})

// WRONG (Bug from Purchases module - AVOIDED here)
await tx.serialNumberMovement.create({
  data: {
    serialNumberId: 0, // ✗ Hardcoded zero
    // ...
  }
})
```

This bug was identified and fixed in the Purchases module, and the fix has been applied to the Sales module from the start.

## Transaction Safety

All stock-affecting operations use Prisma `$transaction()` with:
- 30-second timeout for complex operations
- Automatic rollback on any error
- Atomic operations (all succeed or all fail)
- No partial states left in database

## Next Steps

### Remaining Sales Module Components:
1. ✅ API Endpoints (COMPLETE)
2. ⏳ Product Search API (for POS UI)
3. ⏳ Available Serial Numbers API (for selection)
4. ⏳ Sales UI Pages
5. ⏳ POS Interface
6. ⏳ Receipt Printing
7. ⏳ Comprehensive Testing with Playwright

### Future Modules (from MASTER-INVENTORY-ROADMAP.md):
- Stock Transfers (two-step workflow)
- Customer Returns
- Supplier Returns
- Reporting & Analytics

## Testing Requirements

As mandated by user:
> "Errors are not tolerated in a scenario where money is involved"

Therefore, before marking Sales module as complete:
1. Comprehensive Playwright tests required
2. Test all validation scenarios
3. Test stock deduction accuracy
4. Test serial number tracking
5. Test void/restore functionality
6. Test payment validation
7. Test RBAC permissions
8. Zero tolerance for errors

## Status

**API Implementation**: ✅ COMPLETE (800+ lines)
**Testing**: ⏳ PENDING
**UI**: ⏳ PENDING

**Overall Progress**: ~35% of full inventory system complete
