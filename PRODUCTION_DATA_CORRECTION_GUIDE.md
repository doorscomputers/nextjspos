# PRODUCTION DATA CORRECTION GUIDE
## Fixing Live Data & Justifying Inventory Discrepancies

---

## 🔥 **YOUR CRITICAL QUESTIONS ANSWERED**

### **Question 1: Can Claude fix production data online via VS Code prompts to PostgreSQL?**

**Answer: YES! But with important safety protocols.**

---

## ✅ **How to Safely Correct Production Data with Claude**

### **Method 1: Using Claude Code + VS Code + Database Scripts (RECOMMENDED)**

**What You Can Do:**
1. ✅ Write correction scripts in VS Code
2. ✅ Claude reviews and validates the script
3. ✅ Test on staging/backup first
4. ✅ Execute on production database
5. ✅ Verify results immediately

**Example Workflow:**

```typescript
// In VS Code, ask Claude:
"Claude, I have 50 products where the stock ledger doesn't match actual inventory at Bambang location.
Can you create a script to audit and correct these?"

// Claude creates:
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
const prisma = new PrismaClient({
  datasources: {
    db: {
      url: process.env.DATABASE_URL // Points to production PostgreSQL
    }
  }
})

async function correctInventoryDiscrepancies() {
  // 1. Find discrepancies
  // 2. Create correction records
  // 3. Update product history
  // 4. Generate audit report
}

// You review, then run:
node correct-inventory-bambang.mjs
```

**Safety Checklist:**
- ☑️ **ALWAYS** backup database first
- ☑️ **ALWAYS** test on staging environment
- ☑️ **ALWAYS** use transactions (all-or-nothing)
- ☑️ **ALWAYS** create audit logs
- ☑️ **ALWAYS** verify results before committing
- ☑️ **NEVER** delete historical data
- ☑️ **ALWAYS** add correction records, don't modify existing ones

---

### **Method 2: Direct PostgreSQL Commands (Advanced)**

Claude can generate safe SQL queries:

```sql
-- Step 1: Investigate discrepancy
SELECT
  p.name,
  vld.qty_available AS "System Qty",
  (SELECT SUM(quantity_change) FROM product_history
   WHERE product_variation_id = vld.product_variation_id
   AND location_id = vld.location_id) AS "Ledger Qty",
  vld.qty_available - (SELECT SUM(quantity_change) FROM product_history
   WHERE product_variation_id = vld.product_variation_id
   AND location_id = vld.location_id) AS "Discrepancy"
FROM variation_location_details vld
JOIN products p ON p.id = vld.product_id
WHERE vld.location_id = 3 -- Bambang
HAVING vld.qty_available != (SELECT SUM(quantity_change) FROM product_history...)

-- Step 2: Create correction entry (don't modify existing data!)
INSERT INTO product_history (
  business_id, location_id, product_id, product_variation_id,
  transaction_type, transaction_date, reference_type, reference_id, reference_number,
  quantity_change, balance_quantity, created_by, created_by_name, reason
) VALUES (
  1, 3, 123, 456,
  'correction', CURRENT_DATE, 'inventory_audit', 0, 'AUDIT-2025-001',
  5.00, 100.00, 1, 'System Admin', 'Physical count adjustment - Bambang audit 2025-10-22'
);

-- Step 3: Update current stock
UPDATE variation_location_details
SET qty_available = 100.00
WHERE product_variation_id = 456 AND location_id = 3;
```

---

### **Method 3: Claude-Generated API Correction Scripts**

For complex multi-step corrections:

```typescript
// correct-supplier-returns-accounting.mjs
// Claude generates a comprehensive script that:
// 1. Finds all supplier returns with missing AP adjustments
// 2. Calculates what should have been recorded
// 3. Creates corrective entries
// 4. Updates all affected records
// 5. Generates detailed audit report

// Run: node correct-supplier-returns-accounting.mjs
// Output: PDF report + database corrections
```

## ❌ **What Claude CANNOT Do Directly**

1. ❌ Click buttons in web UIs
2. ❌ Login to your production server
3. ❌ Access your database without credentials
4. ❌ Execute commands without your approval
5. ❌ Make changes without you running the script

**Claude's Role:**
- ✅ Write the correction scripts
- ✅ Validate data integrity
- ✅ Generate audit reports
- ✅ Explain what will happen
- ✅ Review results after you execute

**Your Role:**
- ✅ Provide database access credentials
- ✅ Review and approve scripts
- ✅ Execute scripts on production
- ✅ Verify results
- ✅ Backup first!

### **How to Respond to Branch Manager Complaints**

**Scenario 1: "Why does my stock show 15 but the history says 20?"**

**Your Response:**

> "Let me pull up the complete transaction history for you."

```
PRODUCT HISTORY AUDIT TRAIL for Widget X at Bambang:

Date         Type            Qty Change   Balance   Reference           User
-----------  --------------  -----------  --------  ------------------  --------
2025-10-01   Opening Stock   +50          50        IMPORT-001          System
2025-10-05   Transfer In     +20          70        TRF-202510-001      Admin
2025-10-10   Sale            -30          40        SALE-202510-123     Cashier
2025-10-15   Sale            -10          30        SALE-202510-234     Cashier
2025-10-18   Adjustment      -10          20        ADJ-202510-001      Manager
2025-10-20   Supplier Return -5           15        SR-202510-001       Admin
                                          ====
                              FINAL: 15 units

Your current stock of 15 is CORRECT. Here's why it changed from 50 to 15:
- Started with 50
- Added 20 from warehouse
- Sold 40 total to customers
- Removed 10 damaged units (adjustment)
- Returned 5 defective units to supplier
- Result: 15 units remaining

Every transaction has a reference number. Would you like to review any specific transaction?
```

**Key Talking Points:**
1. ✅ Show the complete history
2. ✅ Explain each transaction type
3. ✅ Reference numbers for audit trail
4. ✅ User names for accountability
5. ✅ Invite them to review specific transactions

---

**Scenario 2: "My physical count shows 18 but system says 15"**

**Your Response:**

> "Great! This is why we do physical counts. Let's create an inventory correction entry."

**Steps:**

1. **Create Physical Count Record:**
```
Physical Count - Bambang - 2025-10-22
Product: Widget X
System Qty: 15
Physical Qty: 18
Difference: +3 (found 3 extra units)
Reason: [Manager explains - maybe customer return not recorded, or transfer not scanned]
```

2. **Create Correction Entry in ProductHistory:**
```
Date: 2025-10-22
Type: Inventory Correction
Qty Change: +3
New Balance: 18
Reference: COUNT-202510-22-BAMBANG
Reason: "Physical count adjustment - found 3 units unrecorded. Likely from customer return on 2025-10-19 not properly logged."
Created By: Branch Manager
Approved By: Warehouse Manager
```

3. **Update Current Stock:**
```
UPDATE variation_location_details
SET qty_available = 18
WHERE product_variation_id = X AND location_id = Bambang

INSERT INTO product_history (...) -- Correction entry
```

**Important Notes:**
- ✅ **ALWAYS** create audit trail
- ✅ **ALWAYS** require manager approval for corrections
- ✅ **ALWAYS** investigate and document reason
- ✅ **NEVER** silently adjust without explanation
- ✅ Keep original history intact, add correction entries

### **Justification Template for Branch Managers**

```markdown
## INVENTORY JUSTIFICATION REPORT
**Date:** 2025-10-22
**Location:** Bambang Branch
**Product:** Widget X (SKU: WX-001)
**Prepared by:** System Admin

### CURRENT STATUS
- **System Quantity:** 15 units
- **Physical Count:** 18 units
- **Discrepancy:** +3 units (system understated)

### TRANSACTION HISTORY (Last 30 Days)
[Paste complete ProductHistory table from SQL query]

### ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
After reviewing transaction history, we identified:
- Issue: Customer return on 2025-10-19 was accepted but not properly logged in system
- Impact: 3 units returned but not added back to inventory
- Evidence: Sales receipt SR-1234 shows return, but no corresponding inventory credit

### CORRECTIVE ACTION TAKEN
1. Created inventory correction entry: COUNT-202510-22-BAMBANG
2. Adjusted system quantity from 15 to 18 units
3. Updated product history with full audit trail
4. Retrained staff on proper return processing procedures

### VERIFICATION
- ✓ Product History balance now matches physical count: 18 units
- ✓ Branch Stock Pivot updated: 18 units
- ✓ Audit trail complete and traceable
- ✓ No historical data deleted or modified

### PREVENTION
- Implemented daily reconciliation checks
- Added validation rule: returns must update inventory immediately
- Monthly physical counts scheduled

**Approval:**
- Branch Manager: _______________ Date: _______
- Warehouse Manager: _______________ Date: _______
- Finance Manager: _______________ Date: _______

### **BEST PRACTICES for Maintaining Inventory Accuracy**

#### **1. Transaction Integrity (What We Just Fixed!)**

✅ **Every transaction MUST update both:**
- Inventory quantity (variation_location_details)
- Product History (complete audit trail)

✅ **Every transaction MUST record:**
- Reference number (SR-202510-0001, not just "1")
- Transaction type (supplier_return, not generic)
- User who performed it
- Date and time
- Reason/notes
- Related party (supplier name, customer name, etc.)

✅ **Examples:**
- ✅ GOOD: "Supplier Return SR-202510-0001 to GRAND TECH (defective)"
- ❌ BAD: "Supplier Return #1"

---

#### **2. Validation Rules**

Implement these checks:

```typescript
// Before any stock operation:
async function validateStockOperation(operation) {
  // 1. Verify quantities match
  const calculatedTotal = items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + (item.qty * item.cost), 0)
  if (Math.abs(calculatedTotal - storedTotal) > 0.01) {
    throw new Error('Total amount mismatch - balance sheet would be unbalanced')
  }

  // 2. Verify sufficient stock (for deductions)
  const currentStock = await getCurrentStock(productId, locationId)
  if (operation.type === 'deduction' && currentStock < operation.quantity) {
    throw new Error('Insufficient stock')
  }

  // 3. Verify ledger matches physical stock
  const ledgerBalance = await calculateLedgerBalance(productId, locationId)
  const physicalStock = await getPhysicalStock(productId, locationId)
  if (Math.abs(ledgerBalance - physicalStock) > 0.01) {
    console.warn('ALERT: Ledger and physical stock mismatch!')
    // Trigger investigation workflow
  }

  return true
}
```

---

#### **3. Regular Reconciliation**

**Daily:**
- Run automated ledger vs physical stock comparison
- Flag discrepancies > 5%
- Generate exception report for managers

**Weekly:**
- Spot-check 10 random products at each location
- Verify ProductHistory balance = variation_location_details

**Monthly:**
- Full physical inventory count
- Create correction entries for all discrepancies
- Root cause analysis for large differences

**Quarterly:**
- Full audit with external verification
- Review and improve inventory processes

---

#### **4. Staff Training**

**Critical Training Points:**
1. ✅ Every action in the system is recorded forever
2. ✅ Never manually adjust without creating proper transaction
3. ✅ Always use proper transaction types (don't repurpose purchase for return)
4. ✅ Always enter complete information (notes, reference numbers)
5. ✅ Physical counts must be accurate - spot checks will verify
6. ✅ System discrepancies must be reported immediately

---

#### **5. Automated Alerts**

Set up alerts for:
- ⚠️ Stock goes negative
- ⚠️ Large single-day quantity changes (>100 units)
- ⚠️ Ledger vs physical stock mismatch > 5%
- ⚠️ High-value items with any discrepancy
- ⚠️ Serial number products with untracked serials
- ⚠️ Transactions without proper notes

# Output:
✓ Main Warehouse: 1,234 products - 99.8% accuracy
✓ Main Store: 567 products - 98.5% accuracy
✓ Bambang: 432 products - 97.2% accuracy
⚠️  Tuguegarao: 345 products - 92.1% accuracy (ALERT!)

Discrepancies Found: 12
High Priority: 3 (value > ₱10,000)
Medium Priority: 5 (value > ₱1,000)
Low Priority: 4 (value < ₱1,000)

[Detailed Report Generated: audit-2025-10-22.pdf]
```

---

### **2. Transaction Integrity Validator**

```bash
# Verify all transactions have proper audit trail
node validate-transaction-integrity.mjs

# Checks:
✓ All ProductHistory entries have reference numbers
✓ All supplier returns have AP adjustments
✓ All sales have corresponding inventory deductions
✓ All transfers have matching in/out entries
✓ All serials are properly tracked
❌ FOUND: 5 supplier returns missing AP adjustment (pre-fix)
    → Run: node fix-missing-ap-adjustments.mjs
```

---

### **3. Discrepancy Investigation Tool**

```bash
# Investigate specific product discrepancy
node investigate-discrepancy.mjs --product=123 --location=Bambang

# Output:
Product: Widget X (SKU: WX-001)
Location: Bambang Branch

SYSTEM STOCK: 15 units
LEDGER BALANCE: 15 units ✓ (matches)
LAST PHYSICAL COUNT: 18 units (2025-10-20) ⚠️ (3 unit difference)

TRANSACTION HISTORY (showing last 20):
[Complete audit trail with drill-down capability]

POTENTIAL CAUSES:
1. Physical count on 2025-10-20 found 3 extra units
2. No correction entry was created
3. Recommendation: Create COUNT-202510-22-BAMBANG correction entry

GENERATE CORRECTION ENTRY? (y/n)
```
