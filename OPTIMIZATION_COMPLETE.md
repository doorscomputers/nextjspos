---

## Troubleshooting

### "Products page not loading"

**Check**:
1. API endpoint responding: `/api/products/devextreme?take=1`
2. Browser console for errors
3. Server logs for errors

**Solution**: Check network tab, ensure API returns 200 OK

### "Search not working"

**Check**:
1. RemoteOperations enabled in DataGrid
2. API endpoint includes search parameter
3. Database has data to search

**Solution**: Verify `searchValue` parameter in API request

### "Export not working"

**Likely Cause**: Exporting too many records

**Solution**:
- Export works on current grid page
- Use "Export Selected" for large datasets
- Excel handles up to 1M rows

### "Performance still slow"

**Check**:
1. Database indexes created: Run `npx tsx scripts/add-performance-indexes.ts`
2. Caching enabled: Check `src/lib/cache.ts` imported
3. RemoteOperations enabled: Check DataGrid config

**Solution**: Review each optimization step

## Technical Architecture

### Server-Side Operations Flow

```
User Types in Search Box
    ↓
DevExtreme Grid (Client)
    ↓
CustomStore.load()
    ↓
API Request: /api/products/devextreme?searchValue=iPhone&skip=0&take=50
    ↓
Server-Side API (Next.js Route)
    ↓
Prisma Database Query (WITH INDEXES!)
    ↓
{data: [...], totalCount: 1234}
    ↓
DevExtreme Grid Displays Results
```

### Caching Architecture

```
API Request
    ↓
Check Memory Cache
    ↓
Cache Hit? → Return Cached Data (< 1ms)
    ↓
Cache Miss? → Fetch from Database
                ↓
            Cache Result (TTL: 60s)
                ↓
            Return Fresh Data
```
