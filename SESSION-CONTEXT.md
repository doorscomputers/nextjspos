# Session Context - Inventory Management Features

**Date**: January 2025
**Developer**: Building Multi-tenant POS System
**Current Status**: Implemented, awaiting restart to test

---

## 🎯 What We Built

### Feature 1: Inventory Corrections Module
**Purpose**: Track and approve stock adjustments for expired/damaged/missing items

**Location**: `src/app/dashboard/inventory-corrections/`

**Status**: ✅ Complete (backend + frontend)

**Next**: Test after Prisma regeneration

---

### Feature 2: Opening Stock Lock Security
**Purpose**: Prevent users from arbitrarily changing inventory

**How**: Auto-locks stock after first entry, requires Inventory Corrections for changes

**Status**: ✅ Complete (backend, UI enhancement pending)

**Next**: Test lock behavior after restart

## 🔧 Critical Actions After Restart

```bash
# 1. Regenerate Prisma Client (REQUIRED)
npx prisma generate

# 2. Push database changes
npm run db:push

# 3. Start server
npm run dev
```

## 🧪 Testing Priorities

1. **Inventory Corrections**: Create → Approve → Verify stock updated
2. **Opening Stock Lock**: Set stock → Try to edit → Verify blocked
3. **Unlock Feature**: Admin unlock with password → Edit → Verify audit log
