## 🚀 Next Steps (Required)

### Step 1: Stop All Dev Servers

Close any running dev servers manually:
- Close VS Code terminal tabs
- Close Command Prompt/PowerShell windows
- Stop XAMPP if running

**Verify no processes on port 3000:**
```bash
npx kill-port 3000
```

### Step 2: Run Prisma Commands

**IMPORTANT**: Must be run with dev server completely stopped.

```bash
# Generate Prisma Client with new models
npx prisma generate

# Push schema to database (creates banks table)
npx prisma db push
```

If you get "EPERM: operation not permitted" error:
1. Restart your computer
2. Delete `node_modules/.prisma` folder
3. Run `npx prisma generate` again

### Step 3: Restart Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Test the System

Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Database Schema

#### Bank Model
```prisma
model Bank {
  id         Int @id @default(autoincrement())
  businessId Int @map("business_id")

  bankName      String @map("bank_name")
  accountType   String @map("account_type") // savings, cheque, credit_card
  accountNumber String @map("account_number")

  // Opening balance
  openingBalance     Decimal   @default(0) @map("opening_balance")
  openingBalanceDate DateTime? @map("opening_balance_date")

  // Current balance (updated by transactions)
  currentBalance Decimal @default(0) @map("current_balance")

  // Account status
  isActive Boolean @default(true) @map("is_active")

  notes String? @db.Text

  // Relations
  bankTransactions BankTransaction[]

  @@unique([businessId, accountNumber])
  @@map("banks")
}
```

#### BankTransaction Model (Updated)
```prisma
model BankTransaction {
  id         Int @id @default(autoincrement())
  businessId Int @map("business_id")

  // NEW: Bank account relation
  bankId Int? @map("bank_id")
  bank   Bank? @relation(fields: [bankId], references: [id])

  paymentId Int? @map("payment_id")
  payment   Payment? @relation(fields: [paymentId], references: [id])

  transactionDate DateTime @map("transaction_date")
  transactionType String   @map("transaction_type")
  // Types: payment, receipt, transfer, opening_balance, manual_debit, manual_credit

  // Amount (positive for credit, negative for debit)
  amount Decimal @db.Decimal(22, 4)

  // Bank details (kept for backwards compatibility)
  bankName          String  @map("bank_name")
  accountNumber     String? @map("account_number")
  transactionNumber String? @map("transaction_number")

  // NEW: Balance after transaction
  balanceAfter Decimal? @map("balance_after")

  description String? @db.Text

  @@index([bankId])
  @@map("bank_transactions")
}
```

### Transaction Types

1. **opening_balance** - Initial balance when creating bank account
2. **payment** - Payment to supplier (debit/money out)
3. **receipt** - Receipt from customer (credit/money in)
4. **manual_debit** - Manual entry for money going out
5. **manual_credit** - Manual entry for money coming in
6. **transfer** - Transfer between accounts

### Amount Convention

- **Debit (Money Out)** = Negative amount (e.g., -5000.00)
- **Credit (Money In)** = Positive amount (e.g., +5000.00)

This follows standard accounting principles where:
- Payments reduce bank balance (debit)
- Receipts increase bank balance (credit)

## 🔄 Payment Integration Flow

### Before Bank System:
```
Payment Created
  ↓
BankTransaction created with bankName only
  ↓
No balance tracking
```

### After Bank System:
```
Payment Created
  ↓
System searches for matching Bank account by name/account number
  ↓
If found:
  ├─ Link BankTransaction to Bank (bankId)
  ├─ Calculate new balance
  ├─ Update Bank.currentBalance
  └─ Set BankTransaction.balanceAfter
  ↓
If not found:
  └─ Create BankTransaction with bankName only (backward compatible)
```
