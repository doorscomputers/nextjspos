# Inventory Corrections Barcode Scanning - Implementation Status

## Date: October 8, 2025

## Summary
Implemented barcode scanning functionality for the Inventory Corrections page with automatic SKU lookup and product selection. However, the system count auto-population is currently blocked by API errors.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Location Auto-Lock ✅
- Users with a single assigned location now have the location field auto-selected and locked
- Implemented in `src/app/dashboard/inventory-corrections/new/page.tsx` (lines 88-106)
- Shows read-only input with user's location name

### 2. Barcode Search Functionality ✅
- Created new API endpoint: `/api/products/variations/search`
- Accepts SKU parameter and returns matching product variation
- Filters by business ID for multi-tenancy
- Returns variation with product information

### 3. Product Selection UX Improvements ✅
- Added barcode search input with Enter key trigger
- Implemented partial text search (contains operator) for product filtering
- Auto-selects product and variation when SKU is found
- Hides variation dropdown when product has only one variation
- Shows success toast with product name when found

### 4. Files Created/Modified
- **Created**: `src/app/api/products/variations/search/route.ts` - Barcode search API
- **Modified**: `src/app/dashboard/inventory-corrections/new/page.tsx` - UI enhancements
- **Modified**: `src/app/api/products/variations/[id]/inventory/route.ts` - Fixed Prisma query

## Current Issues

### Critical Issue: System Count API Returning 500 Error

**Problem**: The `/api/products/variations/{id}/inventory?locationId={id}` endpoint returns HTTP 500

**API Call**: `GET /api/products/variations/2/inventory?locationId=2`

**Impact**: System count field remains blank after barcode scan

**Root Cause**: Unknown - error details are not being logged despite adding comprehensive error handling

**Attempted Fixes**:
1. ✅ Fixed Prisma query to use direct `businessId` instead of nested `product.businessId`
2. ✅ Removed non-existent fields (`product.sku`, `product.barcode`) from select
3. ✅ Added detailed error logging with stack traces
4. ❌ Error still occurs but error message is not visible in logs

### Secondary Issue: Dashboard Stats Error

**Problem**: `/api/dashboard/stats` returns 500 error
**Error**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'sale')`
**Impact**: Dashboard may not load properly, blocking navigation and testing

## How It Should Work

1. User navigates to New Inventory Correction page
2. Location is auto-selected if user has single location assignment
3. User scans barcode or types SKU (e.g., "PCI-0002")
4. User presses Enter
5. System searches for product variation by SKU
6. Product and variation are auto-selected
7. **System count should auto-populate** with current inventory quantity
8. User enters physical count
9. Difference is auto-calculated
10. User submits correction for approval

## Testing Attempts

### Manual Testing
- ✅ Barcode search successfully finds product by SKU
- ✅ Product and variation are auto-selected
- ❌ System count remains blank (500 error from API)

### Automated Testing (Playwright)
- Created test file: `e2e/inventory-corrections-barcode.spec.ts`
- Created simple test script: `test-barcode-simple.js`
- ❌ Tests fail due to dashboard not loading (blocked by stats API error)

## Next Steps to Fix

### 1. Fix Dashboard Stats API (Blocking Issue)
The dashboard stats error is preventing the page from loading properly:
- File: `src/app/api/dashboard/stats/route.ts`
- Error: Prisma import/export mismatch
- Fix: Correct the prisma import statement

### 2. Debug Inventory API Error
Once dashboard loads, investigate the 500 error:
- Add console.log statements before the Prisma query
- Check if variation exists in database
- Verify locationId and variationId are valid
- Check if VariationLocationDetails table has data

### 3. Test Data Verification
Verify test data exists:
```sql
SELECT * FROM product_variations WHERE sku = 'PCI-0002';
SELECT * FROM variation_location_details WHERE product_variation_id = 2 AND location_id = 2;
```

### 4. Alternative Approach
If product doesn't exist at location, return `qtyAvailable: 0` instead of 404 error

### Barcode Search Handler
`src/app/dashboard/inventory-corrections/new/page.tsx:205-260`

### System Count Fetch
`src/app/dashboard/inventory-corrections/new/page.tsx:185-202`

### Inventory API Endpoint
`src/app/api/products/variations/[id]/inventory/route.ts:11-122`

### Search API Endpoint
`src/app/api/products/variations/search/route.ts:10-86`

## Audit Trail & Product History

✅ **Already Implemented**
- Inventory corrections create audit logs when submitted (`src/app/api/inventory-corrections/route.ts:240-274`)
- Stock transactions are created when corrections are approved (`src/app/api/inventory-corrections/[id]/approve/route.ts:92-107`)
- Audit logs include: who, when, what, location, product details, quantities
- Product history tracked via StockTransaction table with reference to inventory_correction

## Conclusion

The core functionality is implemented correctly:
- ✅ Barcode scanning works
- ✅ Product selection works
- ✅ Location locking works
- ✅ Audit trail exists
- ❌ System count auto-population blocked by API error

**The main blocker is the 500 error from the inventory API** which needs debugging to complete the feature.
