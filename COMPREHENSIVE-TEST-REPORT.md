### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
**Status:** VERIFIED

#### Tested Roles:

### 3. Dashboard Functionality
**Status:** CRITICAL ISSUE

#### Test Results:
- Dashboard route is accessible (redirects properly after login)
- Page structure loads (sidebar, header visible)
- **CRITICAL:** Main content area shows infinite loading spinner

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The dashboard appears to be making an async data fetch that never resolves. Possible causes:
1. API endpoint not responding
2. Missing error boundary
3. Infinite loading state without timeout
4. React Suspense boundary issue

#### Impact:
- Users cannot view dashboard statistics
- Cannot access dashboard widgets/metrics
- Affects user experience significantly

#### Recommendations:
1. Add timeout to data fetching (max 10 seconds)
2. Implement error boundaries with retry mechanism
3. Add loading skeleton instead of spinner
4. Verify API endpoints are responding correctly
