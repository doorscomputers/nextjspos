# Analytics Dashboard - Complete Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed âœ…

### Issue #1: Port Mismatch
**Problem**: The `.env` file had `NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"` but the app was running on port 3002.

**Fix**: Updated `.env` to use the correct port:
```env
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3002"
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3002"
```

### Issue #2: Stale Processes on Ports 3000 & 3001
**Problem**: Old Next.js dev servers were still running on ports 3000 and 3001, causing port conflicts.

**Fix**: Killed processes using PowerShell:
```bash
Stop-Process -Id 16668 -Force  # Port 3000
Stop-Process -Id 13788 -Force  # Port 3001
```

### Issue #3: Prisma Type Error in Analytics API
**Problem**: The analytics API was failing with:
```
Argument `businessId`: Invalid value provided. Expected IntFilter or Int, provided String.
```

**Fix**: Explicitly used the converted integer in the inventory query at line 210:
```typescript
businessId: businessId, // Explicitly use the converted integer
```

### Issue #4: Auto-load Performance Issue
**Problem**: The dashboard was trying to auto-load on mount, which could load thousands of data points and slow down the page.

**Fix**: Removed auto-load on mount. Users now click the **"Load Analytics"** button to fetch data manually.

## How to Use the Dashboard Now

### Step 1: Start Clean Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The server should start on **http://localhost:3002**

### Step 2: Access the Dashboard
Navigate to: **http://localhost:3002/dashboard/dashboard-v2**

### Step 3: Load the Data
**Click the "Load Analytics" button** (blue button in the top right)

This will:
- Fetch sales data from the API
- Display 6 KPI cards with metrics
- Show 7 interactive charts
- Display executive insights
- Show the debug panel (in dev mode)

### Step 4: Adjust Filters (If Needed)
If you see "No Sales Data Found":
1. Click "Show Filters"
2. Adjust date range to include your sales (Oct 24-25, 2025)
3. Click "Apply Filters" or "Load Analytics" again

## Expected Results

With your current data (9 sales from Oct 24-25, 2025):

### KPI Cards:
- **Total Transactions**: 9
- **Total Revenue**: â‚±22,780
- **Total Profit**: â‚±6,092
- **Items Sold**: 10
- **Stock Value**: (calculated from inventory)
- **Stock Units**: 6,162

### Executive Insights (New!):

- Average Order Value

### Charts:
1. Sales Trend Over Time (line chart)
2. Top 10 Products (bar chart)
3. Revenue by Category (doughnut chart)

## Troubleshooting

### If Dashboard Doesn't Load:
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Verify you're on **http://localhost:3002** (not 3000 or 3001)
3. Ensure dev server is running: `npm run dev`
4. Hard refresh: Ctrl + F5

### If "Load Analytics" Fails:
1. Check server console for detailed error logs
2. Verify you're logged in as a user with DASHBOARD_VIEW permission
3. Check the Network tab (F12) to see the API response
4. Look for [Analytics] logs in browser console

### If No Data Shows:
1. Check the debug panel - it will show Sales Data Points count
2. Adjust date filters to include your sales dates
3. Click "Try Year-to-Date Range" button
4. Verify sales exist in database

## Files Modified

1. `.env` - Updated ports to 3002
2. `src/app/dashboard/dashboard-v2/page.tsx` - Added manual load, better error handling, executive insights
3. `src/app/api/dashboard/analytics/route.ts` - Fixed businessId type issue

## Next Steps

1. **Stop any running dev servers** (if still running)
2. **Start fresh dev server**: `npm run dev`
3. **Navigate to dashboard**: http://localhost:3002/dashboard/dashboard-v2
4. **Click "Load Analytics"** button
5. **Enjoy your insights!** ðŸ“Š
