#### Step 4: Create Accounts Payable
```bash
POST /api/accounts-payable
{
  "purchaseId": 1,
  "supplierId": 1,
  "invoiceNumber": "SUPP-001",
  "invoiceDate": "2025-10-09",
  "dueDate": "2025-11-08",
  "totalAmount": 1150.00,
  "paymentTerms": 30
}
```
Expected: AP entry created with status "unpaid", balance 1150.00

---

#### Step 5: Make Partial Payment
```bash
POST /api/payments
{
  "accountsPayableId": 1,
  "supplierId": 1,
  "paymentDate": "2025-10-15",
  "paymentMethod": "bank_transfer",
  "amount": 500.00,
  "bankName": "ABC Bank",
  "transactionReference": "TXN-123"
}
```
Expected:
- Payment created with PAY number
- AP paidAmount = 500, balanceAmount = 650
- AP status changes to "partial"
- BankTransaction created

---

#### Step 6: Make Final Payment with Post-Dated Cheque
```bash
POST /api/payments
{
  "accountsPayableId": 1,
  "supplierId": 1,
  "paymentDate": "2025-10-20",
  "paymentMethod": "cheque",
  "amount": 650.00,
  "chequeNumber": "CHQ-789",
  "chequeDate": "2025-11-01",
  "bankName": "XYZ Bank",
  "isPostDated": true
}
```
Expected:
- Payment created
- PostDatedCheque created with status "pending"
- AP paidAmount = 1150, balanceAmount = 0
- AP status changes to "paid"
- BankTransaction created

---

### Test Scenario 2: Aging Analysis
```bash
GET /api/accounts-payable
```
Expected: Returns AP list with aging buckets showing distribution of overdue amounts

---

### Test Scenario 3: Upcoming PDCs
```bash
GET /api/post-dated-cheques?upcoming=true
```
Expected: Returns PDCs due within next 7 days

## Technical Notes

### Multi-Tenancy
- All queries filtered by `businessId`
- User location access enforced via `UserLocation` junction table
- Permission-based data access control

### Transaction Safety
- All multi-step operations use Prisma transactions
- 30-second timeout for complex transactions
- Rollback on any failure
- Atomic inventory updates

### Number Generation Pattern
- PO: `PO-YYYYMM-0001`
- GRN: `GRN-YYYYMM-0001`
- Payment: `PAY-YYYYMM-0001`
- Sequential within month
- Year-month prefix for easy sorting and filtering

### Weighted Average Costing
Used for product purchase price updates:
```
New Cost = (Previous Stock × Previous Cost + New Qty × New Cost) / Total Stock
```

### Audit Trail Strategy
- Every significant action creates AuditLog entry
- ProductHistory created for inventory changes
- Includes user, timestamp, IP, user agent
- Immutable records (no updates, only inserts)

## API Response Formats

### Success Response
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "...": "...data fields...",
  "createdAt": "2025-10-09T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### List Response
```json
{
  "items": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "total": 100,
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 50,
    "totalPages": 2
  }
}
```

### Error Response
```json
{
  "error": "Error message",
  "details": "Detailed error information"
}
```

---

## Database Indexes Strategy

All tables include indexes on:
- `businessId` (for multi-tenant queries)
- Foreign keys (for join performance)
- Status fields (for filtering)
- Date fields (for sorting and date-range queries)
- Unique constraints (for data integrity)

---
