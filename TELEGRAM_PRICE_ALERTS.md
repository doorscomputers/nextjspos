# Telegram Price Change Alerts

## Overview

The system now automatically sends Telegram notifications whenever product prices are changed. This feature provides real-time alerts to business owners and managers about pricing changes across all locations.

## Features

### What Gets Notified

The system sends Telegram alerts for:

1. **Individual Price Changes** - When a single product price is edited
2. **Bulk Price Updates** - When multiple prices are updated at once
3. **Price Imports** - When prices are imported via CSV/Excel files

### Information Included in Alerts

Each price change notification includes:

- **Location Name** - Which branch/location the price applies to
- **Product Name** - The name of the product
- **SKU** - Product SKU for easy identification
- **Old Selling Price** - The previous price (in ‚Ç±)
- **New Selling Price** - The updated price (in ‚Ç±)
- **Price Change** - The difference amount and percentage
- **Changed By** - Username of the person who made the change
- **Change Type** - How the price was changed (Individual Edit, Bulk Update, or Price Import)
- **Timestamp** - When the change was made

### Smart Notification Logic

- **Individual Changes**: When 1-3 prices are updated, sends individual alerts for each product
- **Bulk Updates**: When 4+ prices are updated, sends a summary alert with:
  - Total number of products changed
  - First 5 changes as preview
  - Indication of additional changes beyond the preview

## Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file to enable Telegram notifications:

```env
# Telegram Notifications
TELEGRAM_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=true
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
TELEGRAM_CHAT_IDS=123456789,987654321  # Comma-separated list of chat IDs
```

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create a Telegram Bot

1. Open Telegram and search for `@BotFather`
2. Send `/newbot` command
3. Follow the prompts to:
   - Choose a name for your bot (e.g., "IgoroTech POS Alerts")
   - Choose a username (must end in 'bot', e.g., "igorotech_pos_bot")
4. BotFather will give you a **Bot Token** - save this for the `.env` file

### Step 2: Get Your Chat ID

1. Start a chat with your new bot by clicking the link BotFather provides
2. Send `/start` to your bot
3. Visit this URL in your browser (replace `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN`):
   ```
   https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_BOT_TOKEN/getUpdates
   ```
4. Look for `"chat":{"id":123456789` in the JSON response
5. The number after `"id":` is your **Chat ID**

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file:

```env
TELEGRAM_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=true
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=1234567890:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz
TELEGRAM_CHAT_IDS=123456789
```

**For multiple recipients:**
```env
TELEGRAM_CHAT_IDS=123456789,987654321,456789123
```

### Step 4: Test the Integration

After configuration, test by:

1. Editing a product price in the system
2. Check your Telegram for the notification
3. The message should include all price change details with proper formatting
