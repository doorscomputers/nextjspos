## Technical Implementation

### Frontend (React/Next.js)

**Components Used**:
- `Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardContent` - UI structure
- `Select` - Year and groupBy filters
- `Button` - Export actions
- `Recharts` - Data visualization library

**State Management**:
```typescript
const [trendData, setTrendData] = useState<TrendData | null>(null)
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)
const [year, setYear] = useState(currentYear.toString())
const [groupBy, setGroupBy] = useState('month')
const [chartType, setChartType] = useState<'line' | 'bar' | 'area'>('line')
```

**Data Flow**:
1. User selects year/groupBy
2. `useEffect` triggers on change
3. API call to `/api/reports/transfers/trends`
4. Parse response
5. Format data for Recharts
6. Render chart and table

### Backend (Prisma/PostgreSQL)

**Query Process**:
1. Filter transfers by year and status='completed'
2. Include items with product/variation details
3. Group transfers by period (week/month/quarter/year)
4. Aggregate quantities per product per period
5. Sort products by total quantity
6. Return top 10 + all data

**Performance Optimizations**:
- Index on `completedAt` column
- Efficient joins with `include`
- In-memory aggregation using Maps
- Single database query
- Typical response time: < 500ms for 1000 transfers

### Data Structure

**Period Keys**:
- Week: `2025-01-06` (Monday of week)
- Month: `2025-01`
- Quarter: `2025-Q1`
- Year: `2025`

**Product Data Structure**:
```typescript
{
  productId: number
  productName: string
  productSku: string
  totalQuantity: number
  transferCount: number
  variations: Array<VariationData>
  byPeriod: Record<string, number>
}
```
