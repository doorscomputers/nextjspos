### Test 9: Verify Audit Trail ❌
**Status:** FAILED
**Error:** `Unknown argument 'details'` in Prisma query

**Root Cause:** Incorrect Prisma query syntax for audit logs

**Error Details:**
```
Invalid `prisma.auditLog.findMany()` invocation
Unknown argument `details`. Available options are marked with ?.
```

**Query Issue:**
```typescript
const auditLogs = await prisma.auditLog.findMany({
  where: {
    OR: [
      { entityId: testProductId },
      {
        entityType: 'INVENTORY_CORRECTION',
        details: {  // ❌ This syntax is incorrect
          path: ['productId'],
          equals: testProductId
        }
      }
    ]
  }
})
```

**What Should Have Happened:**
Verify audit logs exist for:
1. Product creation
2. Opening stock creation

2. Navigate to Physical Inventory
3. Verify location dropdown shows only accessible locations
4. Confirm only 2 locations available (not all 4)

**Database State:**
```
Manager user has 0 accessible locations defined in userLocations table
Expected: 2 locations (Tuguegarao, Warehouse)
```

**Impact:** HIGH - Location access control cannot be verified

---

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Missing Application Routes (BLOCKING)
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Pages Returning 404:**
- `/dashboard/sales/*` or `/dashboard/pos/*`
- `/dashboard/inventory/corrections/*`
- `/dashboard/inventory/physical-inventory`
- `/dashboard/products/[id]/opening-stock` (shows runtime error)

**Evidence:**
- Test screenshots show "404 - This page could not be found"
- Runtime error: `ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.next\server\vendor-chunks\@radix-ui.js'`

**Required Action:**
1. Implement missing route files:
   - `src/app/dashboard/sales/new/page.tsx` (or similar)
   - `src/app/dashboard/inventory/corrections/page.tsx`
   - `src/app/dashboard/inventory/corrections/new/page.tsx`
   - `src/app/dashboard/inventory/physical-inventory/page.tsx`
2. Fix opening stock page routing
3. Rebuild application: `npm run build`

---

### 2. Login/Authentication Issues (BLOCKING)
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Symptoms:**
- Login succeeds on first test run, but fails on subsequent tests
- Page remains on login URL instead of redirecting to `/dashboard`
- Blank white screen after login attempt

**Evidence:**
- Test 1 failed: Login timeout
- Test 7 failed: Admin login timeout
- Test 10 failed: Re-login timeout

**Possible Causes:**
1. Session persistence issues between tests
2. NextAuth cookie handling in headless browser
3. Form submission not triggering properly
4. Server-side redirect not working

**Required Action:**
1. Add explicit wait for form submission
2. Clear cookies/session between user switches
3. Add retry logic for login
4. Verify NextAuth configuration for test environment

---

### 3. Location Access Control Not Configured (HIGH)
**Severity:** HIGH
**Issue:** Manager user has 0 accessible locations in `userLocations` table

**Expected Configuration:**
```sql
INSERT INTO UserLocation (userId, locationId, canView, canEdit, canDelete) VALUES
  ((SELECT id FROM User WHERE username = 'manager'), 4, true, true, false), -- Tuguegarao
  ((SELECT id FROM User WHERE username = 'manager'), 3, true, true, false); -- Warehouse
```

**Current State:**
```
Manager user accessible locations: []
Expected: [Tuguegarao, Warehouse]
```

**Required Action:**
1. Update database seed script to add location access
2. Run: `npm run db:seed` or manual SQL insert

---

### 4. Audit Log Query Syntax Error (MEDIUM)
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Issue:** Prisma query uses incorrect syntax for JSON field filtering

**Incorrect Code:**
```typescript
{
  entityType: 'INVENTORY_CORRECTION',
  details: {
    path: ['productId'],
    equals: testProductId
  }
}
```

**Correct Syntax (for JSON fields):**
```typescript
{
  entityType: 'INVENTORY_CORRECTION',
  // Option 1: If productId is at root of details JSON
  details: {
    path: ['productId'],
    equals: testProductId
  }
  // Option 2: If using JSON filter
  AND: [
    { entityType: 'INVENTORY_CORRECTION' },
    // Query corrections directly instead of filtering audit logs
  ]
}
```

**Required Action:**
1. Fix test query syntax
2. Or query inventory corrections directly instead of filtering audit logs

---

### 5. Runtime Build Error (HIGH)
**Severity:** HIGH
**Error:** `ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.next\server\vendor-chunks\@radix-ui.js'`

**Root Cause:** Application build is incomplete or corrupted

**Required Action:**
1. Clean build artifacts: `rm -rf .next`
2. Reinstall dependencies: `npm install`
3. Rebuild: `npm run build`
4. Restart dev server on port 3004

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before Re-testing):

1. **Fix Missing Routes** (Priority: CRITICAL)
   ```bash
   # Create missing route files
   mkdir -p src/app/dashboard/sales/new
   mkdir -p src/app/dashboard/inventory/corrections
   mkdir -p src/app/dashboard/inventory/physical-inventory

   # Copy from existing patterns or create new pages
   ```

2. **Fix Application Build** (Priority: CRITICAL)
   ```bash
   rm -rf .next
   npm install
   npm run build
   # Restart dev server on port 3004
   ```

3. **Configure Location Access** (Priority: HIGH)
   ```sql
   -- Add location access for manager user
   INSERT INTO UserLocation (userId, locationId, canView, canEdit, canDelete)
   SELECT u.id, 4, true, true, false FROM User u WHERE u.username = 'manager'
   UNION ALL
   SELECT u.id, 3, true, true, false FROM User u WHERE u.username = 'manager';
   ```

4. **Fix Test Authentication** (Priority: HIGH)
   - Add session clearing between user switches
   - Increase login timeout to 30 seconds
   - Add retry logic for login failures
   - Verify cookies are properly set

5. **Fix Audit Log Query** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - Correct Prisma query syntax for JSON filtering
   - Or query related entities directly

### Test Improvements:

1. **Add Retry Logic:**
   ```typescript
   async function loginWithRetry(page, username, password, maxRetries = 3) {
     for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
       try {
         await login(page, username, password)
         return
       } catch (error) {
         if (i === maxRetries - 1) throw error
         await page.goto(`${BASE_URL}/login`)
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Add Explicit Session Clearing:**
   ```typescript
   async function logout(page) {
     await page.context().clearCookies()
     await page.goto(`${BASE_URL}/login`)
   }
   ```

3. **Add Page Existence Checks:**
   ```typescript
   // Before navigating, check if route exists
   const response = await page.goto(url)
   if (response?.status() === 404) {
     throw new Error(`Page not found: ${url}`)
   }
   ```

4. **Increase Timeouts for Slow Pages:**
   ```typescript
   test.setTimeout(120000) // 2 minutes per test
   ```

## What Works vs. What Doesn't

### ✅ Working Features:
1. **Database Setup:**
   - PostgreSQL connection working
   - Schema properly migrated
   - Demo users exist
   - Business locations configured

2. **Opening Stock Locking:**
   - Lock mechanism prevents changes after initial setup
   - Validation prevents changes after transactions exist

3. **Basic Page Structure:**
   - Physical inventory page exists (though returns 404)
   - Opening stock page has basic structure

### ❌ Not Working Features:
1. **Application Routes:**
   - Sales/POS pages missing (404)
   - Inventory corrections pages missing (404)
   - Physical inventory page has routing issues
   - Opening stock page has build errors

2. **Authentication Flow:**
   - Login works inconsistently
   - Session persistence between tests fails
   - User switching causes login failures

3. **Location Access:**
   - No location restrictions configured for test users
   - Cannot verify multi-location access control

4. **Complete Workflows:**
   - Cannot test end-to-end product creation → sale → correction flow
   - Cannot verify audit trail completeness
   - Cannot test approval workflows

---

## Next Steps

### To Resume Testing:

1. **Fix the application:**
   - Implement missing routes
   - Rebuild application
   - Configure location access
   - Verify all pages load without 404/errors

2. **Verify manually:**
   - Login as manager → confirm dashboard loads
   - Navigate to Products → confirm page loads
   - Navigate to Sales → confirm page loads
   - Navigate to Inventory Corrections → confirm page loads
   - Navigate to Physical Inventory → confirm page loads

3. **Re-run tests:**
   ```bash
   npx playwright test e2e/inventory-workflow-comprehensive.spec.ts --headed --workers=1
   ```

4. **Monitor for:**
   - All logins succeed
   - All pages load (no 404s)
   - Database records created correctly
   - Audit logs generated

---

## Conclusion

**Current State:** The inventory management workflow **cannot be fully tested** due to critical application issues:
- 50% of required pages return 404 errors
- Login functionality is unreliable in test environment
- Key features are not implemented or accessible

**Blocking Issues:** 7 out of 10 tests failed due to:
1. Missing application routes (4 failures)
2. Login/authentication issues (3 failures)
3. Database query syntax error (1 failure)

**Recommendation:** **HALT TESTING** until application routes are implemented and login issues are resolved. Once these critical blockers are fixed, re-run the comprehensive test suite to verify:
- Product creation with multi-location opening stock
- Sales transactions reducing inventory
- Inventory corrections workflow
- Approval process
- Audit trail completeness
- Location access control

**Estimated Fix Time:** 2-4 hours to implement missing routes and fix authentication issues

**Re-test ETA:** Once fixes are deployed, tests should complete in ~5-10 minutes with all 10 tests passing.
