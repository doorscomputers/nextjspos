# Cost Visibility Permission & Password Change Feature

## üìã Overview

This document describes two new security features added to the POS system:

1. **Cost Visibility Permission** - Control which roles can see purchase costs and prices
2. **User Profile & Password Change** - Allow users to change their own passwords securely

---

## üîê Feature 1: Cost Visibility Permission

### Purpose

Restrict viewing of sensitive cost information (unit costs, subtotals, totals) in purchase-related pages to authorized roles only. This prevents unauthorized users from seeing supplier costs and profit margins.

### Permission Details

**Permission Name:** `purchase.view_cost`

**Description:** View purchase costs and prices

**Default Assignment:**
- ‚úÖ Super Admin - Yes
- ‚úÖ Branch Admin - Yes
- ‚ùå Branch Manager - No (by default, can be enabled)
- ‚ùå Cashier - No (by default, can be enabled)

### Pages Where Cost is Hidden

#### 1. Purchase Order Detail Page (`/dashboard/purchases/[id]`)
- **Hidden:** Unit Cost per item
- **Hidden:** Summary box (Subtotal, Tax, Discount, Shipping, Total)
- **Visible:** Ordered quantity, Received quantity, Remaining quantity

#### 2. Goods Received Note (GRN) Detail Page (`/dashboard/purchases/receipts/[id]`)
- **Hidden:** Unit Cost column in table
- **Hidden:** Total column in table
- **Hidden:** Grand Total in footer
- **Visible:** Product name, SKU, Ordered quantity, Received quantity

#### 3. Purchase Orders List Page
- **Always Visible:** Total amount (needed for approval workflow)
- *Note: Only total shown, not individual costs*

### Implementation Details

```typescript
// Permission check in components
const { can } = usePermissions()

// Hide cost column
{can(PERMISSIONS.PURCHASE_VIEW_COST) && (
  <th className="text-right py-3 px-4">Unit Cost</th>
)}

// Hide summary section
{can(PERMISSIONS.PURCHASE_VIEW_COST) && (
  <div className="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow">
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    {/* Cost details */}
  </div>
)}
```

### Setup Instructions

#### Enable Cost Viewing for a Role:

1. Login as **Super Admin**
2. Go to **User Management** ‚Üí **Roles & Permissions**
3. Click **Edit** on the desired role
4. Scroll to **Purchase** section
5. Check the box for **"view cost"** permission
6. Click **Update**
7. Users with this role can now see costs

#### Create a Script to Add Permission:

```bash
node add-cost-permission.js
```

This script:
- Creates `purchase.view_cost` permission in database
- Assigns it to Super Admin role
- Assigns it to Branch Admin role

## üë§ Feature 2: User Profile & Password Change

### Purpose

Allow users to securely change their own passwords without administrator intervention. This enforces individual accountability for transactions and prevents password sharing.

### Key Features

#### 1. User Profile Page (`/dashboard/profile`)

**Location in Sidebar:** "My Profile" (accessible to all users, no permission required)

**Sections:**

**a) Account Information**
- Display: Name, Username, Email, Role
- Read-only (users cannot edit these fields themselves)

**b) Change Password Form**
- Current Password (required)
- New Password (required, min 6 characters)
- Confirm New Password (required, must match)
- Security best practices tips

**c) Security Notice Card**
- Password guidelines
- Security recommendations

#### 2. Password Change API (`/api/user/change-password`)

**Method:** POST

**Authentication:** Required (uses session)

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "currentPassword": "old-password",
  "newPassword": "new-password"
}
```

**Validations:**
- ‚úÖ User must be logged in
- ‚úÖ Current password must be correct
- ‚úÖ New password minimum 6 characters
- ‚úÖ Passwords are bcrypt hashed
- ‚úÖ Audit log created for password changes

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Password changed successfully"
}
```

**Error Responses:**
- `401` - Unauthorized (not logged in)
- `400` - Current password incorrect
- `400` - New password too short
- `400` - Validation errors

#### 3. Default Password for New Users

**Default Password:** `123456`

**Implementation:**
- When creating a user, if password is not provided, default to "123456"
- Admin can optionally provide a different password
- User must change password on first login (optional feature, not yet implemented)

**Modified API:** `/api/users` (POST endpoint)

```typescript
// Use provided password or default to "123456"
const userPassword = password || '123456'
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(userPassword, 10)
```

### User Workflow

#### For New Users:

1. **Admin creates user account**
   - Admin goes to User Management ‚Üí Users ‚Üí Add User
   - Admin fills in username, name, role, locations
   - Admin leaves password blank or sets custom password
   - System uses default password "123456" if blank

2. **User receives credentials**
   - Username: (provided by admin)
   - Password: 123456 (or custom if admin set one)

3. **User logs in**
   - User logs in with provided credentials
   - **(Future feature)** System prompts to change password on first login

4. **User changes password**
   - User clicks "My Profile" in sidebar
   - User fills in Current Password, New Password, Confirm Password
   - User clicks "Change Password"
   - System validates and updates password
   - User must use new password for next login

#### Security Benefits:

‚úÖ **Individual Accountability** - Each user has unique password
‚úÖ **No Password Sharing** - Users can't blame others for their actions
‚úÖ **Audit Trail** - Password changes are logged
‚úÖ **Transaction Integrity** - Approvals tied to specific user credentials
‚úÖ **Simple Setup** - Admins don't need to create complex passwords
‚úÖ **User Control** - Users manage their own password security

### Implementation Files

#### Created Files:
1. `src/app/dashboard/profile/page.tsx` - User profile page
2. `src/app/api/user/change-password/route.ts` - Password change API
3. `add-cost-permission.js` - Script to add cost permission to database

#### Modified Files:
1. `src/lib/rbac.ts` - Added PURCHASE_VIEW_COST permission
2. `src/app/dashboard/purchases/[id]/page.tsx` - Hide costs based on permission
3. `src/app/dashboard/purchases/receipts/[id]/page.tsx` - Hide costs based on permission
4. `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` - Added "My Profile" menu item
5. `src/app/api/users/route.ts` - Default password "123456" for new users

## üîí Security Considerations

### Cost Visibility

- **Data Sensitivity:** Purchase costs are sensitive business data
- **Profit Protection:** Prevents unauthorized users from calculating profit margins
- **Supplier Relationships:** Protects negotiated supplier pricing
- **Role-Based:** Only authorized roles can view costs

### Password Management

- **Password Hashing:** All passwords stored as bcrypt hashes (salt rounds: 10)
- **Session Security:** Password change requires active session
- **Audit Logging:** Password changes recorded in audit log
- **No Password Recovery:** Users cannot reset forgotten passwords (admin must reset)
- **Validation:** Minimum 6 characters enforced (can be increased)

### Future Enhancements

1. ‚è≥ **Force Password Change on First Login**
   - Add `mustChangePassword` flag to User model
   - Redirect to password change on first login
   - Prevent access to other pages until password changed

2. ‚è≥ **Password Strength Requirements**
   - Require uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
   - Minimum 8-12 characters
   - Password strength meter in UI

3. ‚è≥ **Password Expiry Policy**
   - Force password change every 90 days
   - Warning before expiry
   - Prevent password reuse

4. ‚è≥ **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
   - OTP via SMS or email
   - Authenticator app support
   - Backup codes

5. ‚è≥ **Hide Product Costs Permission**
   - Similar to purchase costs
   - Hide purchase price in product pages
   - Control profit margin visibility

## üìä Database Changes

### New Permission

```sql
INSERT INTO Permission (name) VALUES ('purchase.view_cost');
```

### Assigned to Roles

```sql
-- Super Admin (automatically has all permissions via code)
-- Branch Admin
INSERT INTO RolePermission (roleId, permissionId)
SELECT r.id, p.id
FROM Role r, Permission p
WHERE r.name = 'Branch Admin' AND p.name = 'purchase.view_cost';
```
