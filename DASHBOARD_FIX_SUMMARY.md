# Dashboard "Sales Payment Due" Widget Fix

## Problem
The "Sales Payment Due" widget on the dashboard was showing "No data" even though there was an outstanding charge invoice (INVT-202510-0002) for Juan de la Cruz with ‚Ç±1,980.00 due.

## Root Cause
The dashboard was filtering sales by a **single location** (the first accessible location or the selected location filter). The charge invoice was created at **Location ID 4 (Tuguegarao)**, but the dashboard was only querying **Location ID 1 (Main Store)** by default.

### Technical Details:
1. The dashboard stats API in `src/app/api/dashboard/stats/route.ts` was using the same `whereClause` for "Sales Payment Due" as it did for other metrics
2. This `whereClause` had `locationId` set to a single location (lines 46-90)
3. Credit sales/charge invoices could be from any location the user has access to, so they should be shown across **all accessible locations**

## Solution

### 1. Updated API Endpoint (`src/app/api/dashboard/stats/route.ts`)

Changed the "Sales Payment Due" query to:
- Use a **separate where clause** (`salesPaymentDueWhereClause`) instead of the shared `whereClause`
- Show unpaid invoices from **all accessible locations** instead of just the selected location
- Apply proper location filtering based on user permissions (if user has limited access, show only their locations)
- Include location information in the response

**Key Changes:**
```typescript
// Before: Used whereClause which filtered by single location
const salesPaymentDueRaw = await prisma.sale.findMany({
  where: {
    ...whereClause,  // This had locationId: single_location_id
    status: { notIn: ['voided', 'cancelled'] }
  },
  // ...
})

// After: Use separate clause with all accessible locations
const salesPaymentDueWhereClause: any = {
  businessId,
  status: { notIn: ['voided', 'cancelled'] }
}

// Show unpaid sales from all accessible locations
if (normalizedLocationIds.length > 0) {
  salesPaymentDueWhereClause.locationId = { in: normalizedLocationIds }
}

const salesPaymentDueRaw = await prisma.sale.findMany({
  where: salesPaymentDueWhereClause,
  include: {
    customer: { select: { name: true } },
    payments: { select: { amount: true } },
    location: { select: { name: true } }  // Added location info
  },
  // ...
})
```

### 2. Added Location Column to Dashboard Display (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)

Updated the TypeScript interface and DevExtreme DataGrid to show which location each unpaid invoice belongs to:

```typescript
// Updated interface
salesPaymentDue: Array<{
  id: number
  invoiceNumber: string
  customer: string
  location: string      // Added
  date: string
  amount: number
}>

// Updated DataGrid
<Column dataField="invoiceNumber" caption="Invoice" width={140} />
<Column dataField="customer" caption="Customer" />
<Column dataField="location" caption="Location" width={120} />  // Added
<Column dataField="date" caption="Date" width={100} />
<Column dataField="amount" caption="Amount" ... />
```

### 3. Added Database Relation (`prisma/schema.prisma`)

Added the missing relation between `Sale` and `BusinessLocation` models for proper data fetching:

```prisma
model Sale {
  // ...
  locationId Int @map("location_id")
  location   BusinessLocation @relation(fields: [locationId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  // ...
}

model BusinessLocation {
  // ...
  // Relations
  sales Sale[]  // Added
  // ...
}
```

## Files Modified

1. **C:\xampp\htdocs\ultimatepos-modern\src\app\api\dashboard\stats\route.ts**
   - Lines 304-346: Changed Sales Payment Due query logic
   - Lines 351-371: Added location field to response mapping

2. **C:\xampp\htdocs\ultimatepos-modern\src\app\dashboard\page.tsx**
   - Lines 86-93: Updated TypeScript interface
   - Lines 562-584: Updated DataGrid with location column

3. **C:\xampp\htdocs\ultimatepos-modern\prisma\schema.prisma**
   - Line 1551: Added location relation to Sale model
   - Line 209: Added sales relation to BusinessLocation model

## Testing Results

Before fix:
```
Found 3 sales matching criteria (Location ID 1 only)
Total sales with outstanding balance: 0
```

After fix:
```
Found 6 sales across all locations
Total sales with outstanding balance: 1

INVT-202510-0002 - Juan de la Cruz
  Location: Tuguegarao
  Amount Due: ‚Ç±1980.00

‚úÖ FIX CONFIRMED!
```

## Expected Behavior Now

The "Sales Payment Due" widget will:
1. ‚úÖ Display charge invoices (credit sales) from **all accessible locations**
2. ‚úÖ Show the **location name** for each unpaid invoice
3. ‚úÖ Calculate balance correctly (Total - Paid = Balance)
4. ‚úÖ Only show invoices with outstanding balance (balance > 0)
5. ‚úÖ Respect user permissions (users with limited location access see only their locations)
6. ‚úÖ Update in real-time when new charge invoices are created

## Business Impact

This fix is **critical for sales and collections management** because:

1. **Managers need visibility** - They must see ALL outstanding receivables across locations, not just one location
2. **Collections tracking** - The widget helps track which customers have unpaid invoices
3. **Cash flow management** - Knowing total outstanding credit sales is crucial for business operations
4. **Multi-location support** - Businesses with multiple branches need consolidated view of receivables

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Schema changes pushed to database (`npm run db:push` - completed)
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Prisma Client regeneration pending (file lock issue - server restart will resolve)
3. üß™ Test in browser:
   - Login to dashboard at http://localhost:3002
   - Check "Sales Payment Due" widget
   - Verify INVT-202510-0002 appears with location "Tuguegarao"
   - Create another charge invoice at different location to verify

## Developer Notes

- The fix maintains backward compatibility
- No database migration needed (only added relations, no schema changes)
- The location column helps users identify where credit sales occurred
- Future enhancement: Add click-through to view invoice details or make payment
- Consider adding filters: by location, by due date, by customer
