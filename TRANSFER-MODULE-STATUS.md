- ‚úÖ Printable receipt format designed

### 3. Status Flow
```
DRAFT ‚Üí PENDING_CHECK ‚Üí CHECKED ‚Üí IN_TRANSIT ‚Üí ARRIVED ‚Üí
VERIFYING ‚Üí VERIFIED ‚Üí COMPLETED
     ‚Üì          ‚Üì           ‚Üì          ‚Üì           ‚Üì
  CANCELLED  CANCELLED  CANCELLED  DISCREPANCY  PARTIAL
```

## üîÑ In Progress

### API Endpoints
Basic endpoints exist, need enhancement for new workflow:
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/transfers` - List transfers
- ‚úÖ `POST /api/transfers` - Create transfer (status: draft)
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/transfers/[id]` - Get details
- ‚úÖ `POST /api/transfers/[id]/submit-for-check` - Created

**Need to create:**
- `POST /api/transfers/[id]/check-approve` - Origin checker approves
- `POST /api/transfers/[id]/check-reject` - Reject back to draft
- `POST /api/transfers/[id]/send` - Mark as in_transit + deduct stock
- `POST /api/transfers/[id]/mark-arrived` - Destination confirms arrival
- `POST /api/transfers/[id]/start-verification` - Begin item checking
- `POST /api/transfers/[id]/verify-item` - Check individual item
- `POST /api/transfers/[id]/complete` - Final completion + add stock
- `POST /api/transfers/[id]/cancel` - Cancel at any stage

## üìã Next Steps

### Priority 1: Complete API Implementation
1. Create check-approve endpoint (pending_check ‚Üí checked)
2. Create send endpoint (checked ‚Üí in_transit, **DEDUCT STOCK**)
3. Create mark-arrived endpoint (in_transit ‚Üí arrived)
4. Create verification endpoints (arrived ‚Üí verifying ‚Üí verified)
5. Create complete endpoint (verified ‚Üí completed, **ADD STOCK**)
6. Create cancel endpoint (any ‚Üí cancelled, restore stock if needed)

### Priority 2: UI Development
1. **Transfer List Page** (`/dashboard/transfers`)
   - Filter by status, location
   - Status badges with colors
   - Action buttons based on current status

2. **Create Transfer Page** (`/dashboard/transfers/create`)
   - Location selection (from/to)
   - Product selection
   - Quantity and serial number entry
   - Save as draft

3. **Transfer Details Page** (`/dashboard/transfers/[id]`)
   - Timeline showing workflow progress
   - Action buttons based on permissions and status
   - Item list with verification checkboxes
   - Notes and comments section

4. **Printable Receipt** (`/dashboard/transfers/[id]/print`)
   - Professional transfer document
   - Origin/destination details
   - Checker/sender/receiver signatures
   - Barcode for quick lookup

### Priority 3: Testing
1. Create transfer (draft)
2. Submit for checking
3. Origin checker approves
4. Send transfer (stock deducted)
5. Mark arrived at destination
6. Verify items one by one
7. Complete transfer (stock added)
8. Verify audit trail

## üéØ Key Features

### Multi-Stage Approval
‚úÖ Origin creator ‚Üí Origin checker ‚Üí Transit ‚Üí Destination receiver ‚Üí Destination verifier ‚Üí Completion

### Stock Management
- ‚è≥ Stock only deducted when status = IN_TRANSIT
- ‚è≥ Stock only added when status = COMPLETED
- ‚è≥ Stock restored if cancelled after IN_TRANSIT

### Verification System
- ‚è≥ Origin checker must verify items before sending
- ‚è≥ Destination verifier checks each item with checkbox
- ‚è≥ Discrepancy reporting
- ‚è≥ Partial acceptance support

### Audit Trail
- ‚úÖ All status changes logged
- ‚úÖ User tracking at each stage
- ‚úÖ Timestamps for every action
- ‚úÖ Complete history preserved

### Printable Receipt
- ‚è≥ Professional transfer document
- ‚è≥ Shows all approval stages
- ‚è≥ Signature sections
- ‚è≥ Barcode/QR for mobile access

## üîê Permissions Matrix

| Action | Permission Required | Additional Check |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| Create | STOCK_TRANSFER_CREATE | Access to origin location |
| Submit for Check | STOCK_TRANSFER_CREATE | Creator only |
| Check/Approve | STOCK_TRANSFER_CHECK | Access to origin location |
| Send | STOCK_TRANSFER_SEND | Access to origin location |
| Mark Arrived | STOCK_TRANSFER_RECEIVE | Access to destination location |
| Verify Items | STOCK_TRANSFER_VERIFY | Access to destination location |
| Complete | STOCK_TRANSFER_COMPLETE | Access to destination location |
| Cancel | STOCK_TRANSFER_CANCEL | Location-dependent |

## üìä Current Database State

### StockTransfer Fields
```typescript
{
  id, businessId, transferNumber
  fromLocationId, toLocationId, transferDate
  status  // draft, pending_check, checked, in_transit, arrived, verifying, verified, completed, cancelled
  stockDeducted  // true only when in_transit or later

  createdBy      // Who created the transfer
  checkedBy      // Origin checker
  checkedAt
  checkerNotes

  sentBy         // Who physically sent it
  sentAt

  arrivedBy      // Who confirmed arrival
  arrivedAt

  verifiedBy     // Who verified items
  verifiedAt
  verifierNotes

  completedBy    // Who finalized
  completedAt

  cancelledBy
  cancelledAt
  cancellationReason

  hasDiscrepancy
  discrepancyNotes
}
```

### StockTransferItem Fields
```typescript
{
  id, stockTransferId
  productId, productVariationId, quantity

  serialNumbersSent      // JSON array from origin
  serialNumbersReceived  // JSON array verified at destination

  receivedQuantity  // Actual qty received (may differ)
  verified          // Checkbox confirmed
  verifiedBy
  verifiedAt

  hasDiscrepancy
  discrepancyNotes
}
```

## üöÄ How to Continue

### Option 1: Complete API First
Run through all API endpoint creation, then build UI

### Option 2: Build UI with Existing APIs
Create UI using existing transfer APIs, enhance workflow later

### Option 3: MVP Approach
1. Create simple transfer (draft ‚Üí completed directly)
2. Test basic flow
3. Add approval stages incrementally

## Recommended: Start with Simplified Flow

For faster delivery, implement in phases:

**Phase 1: Basic Transfer**
- Create ‚Üí Sent ‚Üí Received ‚Üí Completed
- Stock deducted on sent, added on completed

**Phase 2: Add Checking**
- Add checker approval before sending

**Phase 3: Add Verification**
- Add item-by-item verification at destination

**Phase 4: Polish**
- Printable receipts
- Discrepancy handling
- Cancellation with stock restoration

Would you like me to proceed with the complete multi-stage implementation or start with a simplified MVP version first?
