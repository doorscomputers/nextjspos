   - Return type (refund/replacement)
   - Notes (optional)
   - Serial numbers (if applicable)
4. Calculate total refund amount automatically

   - Must select at least one item
   - Must specify condition for all items
9. Success → Redirect to return detail page
10. Error handling with clear messages

**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

**Complexity**: Medium

## 📝 API Integration

The UI uses these API endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/customer-returns` | GET | List returns with filters |
| `/api/customer-returns` | POST | Create new return (UI TODO) |
| `/api/customer-returns/[id]` | GET | Get return details |
| `/api/customer-returns/[id]/approve` | POST | Approve return (stock restoration) |
| `/api/customer-returns/[id]` | DELETE | Reject return |

All endpoints are fully functional and tested. See `CUSTOMER-RETURNS-API-COMPLETE.md` for API details.

---

## 🎨 Design Decisions

1. **Condition Badges**: Color-coded for quick visual identification
   - Green (resellable) = good
   - Orange (damaged) = warning
   - Red (defective) = critical

2. **Stock Restoration Alert**: Prominent display on pending returns shows exactly what will happen on approval

3. **Permission Gating**: All action buttons check permissions before displaying

4. **Mobile Responsive**: All pages work on phones and tablets

5. **Audit Trail**: Every action creates detailed log entries (backend)

6. **No Dark-on-Dark**: Following user preference for good contrast

---

## 🔍 Key Technical Details

### Stock Restoration Logic:
```typescript
if (condition === 'resellable') {
  // ADD quantity to stock
  // Mark serial numbers as "returned"
  // Available for immediate resale
}

if (condition === 'damaged' || condition === 'defective') {
  // DO NOT restore stock
  // Mark serial numbers with appropriate status
  // Track for records/warranty
}
```

### Approval Process:
1. User clicks "Approve Return"
2. Frontend calls `POST /api/customer-returns/[id]/approve`
3. Backend uses atomic transaction:
   - Updates variationLocationDetails (resellable only)
   - Creates stock transactions
   - Updates serial number statuses and locations
   - Sets return status to "approved"
   - Creates audit log
4. Frontend refreshes return data
5. Success message displayed
