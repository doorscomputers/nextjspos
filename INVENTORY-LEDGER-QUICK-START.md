## Understanding the Report

### Starting Point (Baseline)
The report starts from your LAST inventory correction. This is the most recent "known-correct" count.

If no correction exists, it starts from the first transaction.

### Transaction Types

| Type | Meaning | Impact |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Stock Received** | Goods received from supplier (GRN) | ‚ûï Increases inventory |
| **Stock Sold** | Items sold to customers | ‚ûñ Decreases inventory |
| **Transfer In** | Stock received from another location | ‚ûï Increases inventory |
| **Transfer Out** | Stock sent to another location | ‚ûñ Decreases inventory |
| **Sales Return** | Customer returned items | ‚ûï Increases inventory |
| **Purchase Return** | Items returned to supplier | ‚ûñ Decreases inventory |
| **Inventory Correction** | Manual adjustment after physical count | ‚ûï‚ûñ Can increase or decrease |

### Running Balance
The "Running Balance" column shows inventory level after each transaction. The final balance should match your current system inventory.

### Variance
If the calculated final balance doesn't match your current system inventory, you'll see a variance amount. This indicates:
- Missing transactions
- Unapproved transactions
- Data entry errors
- Physical discrepancies

## Troubleshooting

### "No Baseline Found"
**Problem:** No inventory correction exists for this product/location.

**Solution:**
1. Create an inventory correction first (Physical Inventory menu)
2. Or use the optional date range to manually set start date

### Report Shows Discrepancy
**Problem:** Calculated balance ‚â† System inventory.

**Solution:**
1. Review all transactions carefully
2. Check for pending/unapproved transactions
3. Look for transactions created outside the system
4. Perform physical count and create correction

### No Transactions Shown
**Problem:** Report is empty.

**Possible Causes:**
- Wrong product or location selected
- No transactions in the date range
- All transactions are still pending (not approved)

**Solution:**
1. Verify product and location selection
2. Check transaction statuses (must be approved/completed)
3. Adjust date range

### Today's Transactions Missing
**Problem:** Sales made today not showing.

**Cause:** Report might have been run before transactions were created.

**Solution:**
- Regenerate the report (it includes everything up to current time)

## Best Practices

### 1. Regular Corrections
- Perform inventory corrections regularly (monthly/quarterly)
- This creates clean baseline points for audits

### 2. Immediate Investigation
- If variance detected, investigate immediately
- Document findings and create correction if needed

### 3. Access Control
- Only give export permission to trusted staff
- Monitor who accesses the report (audit logs)

### 4. Record Keeping
- Export and save reports for compliance
- Keep records for tax/audit purposes

### 5. Reconciliation
- Use this report during month-end closing
- Verify inventory before financial statements

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Month-End Verification
"I need to verify inventory before closing the month."

‚Üí Generate report for all key products, check reconciliation status

### 2. Audit Trail
"Auditor needs to see proof of inventory movements."

‚Üí Export report to Excel, provide as supporting document

### 3. Discrepancy Investigation
"System shows 100 units but we only have 95."

‚Üí Generate report, review each transaction to find missing items

### 4. Theft Detection
"Inventory keeps disappearing without sales."

Transactions:
Jan 5: Stock Received +100 = Balance: 150
Jan 7: Stock Sold -25 = Balance: 125
Jan 10: Transfer Out -20 = Balance: 105
Jan 12: Sales Return +5 = Balance: 110

Calculated Final Balance: 110 units
Current System Inventory: 110 units
Variance: 0
Status: ‚úÖ MATCHED
```
