# Dashboard Pending Shipments Fix ✅

## Overview

**Issue**: Pending Shipments section in Dashboard showing "No pending shipments" even when transfers exist
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**
**Date**: 2025-10-20

---

## 🐛 Problem Description

### What Was Happening

The Dashboard Overview page has a "Pending Shipments" section that displays stock transfers in progress. However:

- ❌ Section always showed "No pending shipments"
- ❌ Actual pending transfers were not displayed
- ❌ Users with transfer permissions couldn't see their pending shipments
- ❌ Made it difficult to track stock transfers in progress

### Root Cause

**File**: `src/app/api/dashboard/stats/route.ts` (Lines 260-273)

The pending shipments query was **completely commented out** and replaced with an empty array:

```typescript
// Pending Shipments (Stock Transfers in transit) - TODO: Fix relation names
const pendingShipments: any[] = [] // Placeholder until StockTransfer relations are fixed
```

The comment indicated uncertainty about the relation names, but in reality the relation names (`fromLocation` and `toLocation`) were correct in the Prisma schema.

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Code Changes

**File**: `src/app/api/dashboard/stats/route.ts`

**Before** (Lines 260-273):
```typescript
// Pending Shipments (Stock Transfers in transit) - TODO: Fix relation names
const pendingShipments: any[] = [] // Placeholder until StockTransfer relations are fixed
// const pendingShipments = await prisma.stockTransfer.findMany({
//   where: {
//     businessId,
//     status: { in: ['submitted', 'checked', 'approved', 'sent', 'arrived'] },
//   },
//   include: {
//     fromLocation: { select: { name: true } },
//     toLocation: { select: { name: true } },
//   },
//   orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' },
//   take: 10,
//   })
```

**After** (Lines 260-294):
```typescript
// Pending Shipments (Stock Transfers in transit or pending)
// Show transfers that are not yet completed or cancelled
// Filter by user's accessible locations (either fromLocation or toLocation)
const transferWhereClause: any = {
  businessId,
  status: {
    notIn: ['completed', 'cancelled']
  },
}

// Apply location filtering for transfers
// Show transfers where user has access to either source or destination location
if (accessibleLocationIds !== null) {
  const normalizedLocationIds = accessibleLocationIds
    .map((id) => Number(id))
    .filter((id): id is number => Number.isFinite(id) && Number.isInteger(id))
    .filter((id) => businessLocationIds.includes(id))

  if (normalizedLocationIds.length > 0) {
    transferWhereClause.OR = [
      { fromLocationId: { in: normalizedLocationIds } },
      { toLocationId: { in: normalizedLocationIds } },
    ]
  }
}

const pendingShipments = await prisma.stockTransfer.findMany({
  where: transferWhereClause,
  include: {
    fromLocation: { select: { name: true } },
    toLocation: { select: { name: true } },
  },
  orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' },
  take: 10,
})
```

### Key Improvements

1. ✅ **Enabled the query** - Uncommented and activated the database query
2. ✅ **Proper status filtering** - Shows all non-completed/non-cancelled transfers
3. ✅ **Location-based access control** - Users only see transfers they have access to
4. ✅ **Bi-directional location filtering** - Shows transfers where user has access to either source OR destination location
5. ✅ **Correct relation names** - Confirmed `fromLocation` and `toLocation` are correct
6. ✅ **Recent transfers first** - Ordered by `createdAt DESC`
7. ✅ **Limit to 10 items** - Shows top 10 most recent pending transfers

## 🎯 What Statuses Are Considered "Pending"?

The fix shows transfers with any status **except**:
- ❌ `completed` - Transfer fully completed
- ❌ `cancelled` - Transfer cancelled

**Pending statuses include**:
- ✅ `draft` - Created but not submitted
- ✅ `pending_check` - Awaiting origin check
- ✅ `checked` - Origin checked, ready to send
- ✅ `in_transit` - Sent, stock deducted, in transit
- ✅ `arrived` - Arrived at destination
- ✅ `verifying` - Being verified at destination
- ✅ `verified` - Verified, awaiting completion
- ✅ `partial` - Partially received/completed
- ✅ `discrepancy` - Has discrepancies to resolve

This ensures users see ALL transfers that need attention or action.

---

## 🔒 Location-Based Security

### How Location Filtering Works

Users can only see transfers where they have access to **either**:
1. **Source location** (`fromLocationId`)
2. **Destination location** (`toLocationId`)

**Example Scenarios**:

#### Scenario 1: User with ACCESS_ALL_LOCATIONS permission
```
User: Admin
Permissions: ACCESS_ALL_LOCATIONS
Result: Sees ALL pending transfers across all locations
```

#### Scenario 2: User assigned to specific locations
```
User: Branch Manager
Assigned Locations: Main Warehouse (ID: 1)
Transfer A: Main Warehouse → Bambang Branch
  ✅ VISIBLE (user has access to Main Warehouse)
Transfer B: Bambang Branch → Calamba Branch
  ❌ NOT VISIBLE (user doesn't have access to either location)
```

#### Scenario 3: Transfer Checker role
```
User: Transfer Checker
Assigned Locations: Main Warehouse (ID: 1), Bambang Branch (ID: 2)
Transfer A: Main Warehouse → Bambang Branch
  ✅ VISIBLE (user has access to BOTH locations)
Transfer B: Main Warehouse → Calamba Branch
  ✅ VISIBLE (user has access to Main Warehouse - source)
Transfer C: Calamba Branch → SM City
  ❌ NOT VISIBLE (user doesn't have access to either location)
```

## 📊 Dashboard Display

### Data Shown for Each Transfer

The dashboard displays:
- **Transfer #**: Unique transfer number (e.g., TRF-000001)
- **Route**: From Location → To Location
- **Status**: Current transfer status
- **Date**: Transfer creation date

### Table Format

```
+-------------+-----------------------------+-------------+------------+
| Transfer #  | Route                       | Status      | Date       |
+-------------+-----------------------------+-------------+------------+
| TRF-000001  | Main Warehouse → Bambang    | in_transit  | 2025-10-20 |
| TRF-000002  | Bambang → SM City           | checked     | 2025-10-19 |
| TRF-000003  | Main Warehouse → Calamba    | draft       | 2025-10-19 |
+-------------+-----------------------------+-------------+------------+
```

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Manual Testing Steps

#### Test 1: Create a Pending Transfer
1. Login as user with transfer permissions
2. Navigate to `/dashboard/transfers/create`
3. Create a new transfer (any status except completed/cancelled)
4. Go back to `/dashboard`
5. **Expected**: Transfer appears in "Pending Shipments" section ✅

#### Test 2: Complete a Transfer
1. Open a pending transfer
2. Complete the transfer workflow until status = 'completed'
3. Go back to `/dashboard`
4. **Expected**: Transfer no longer appears in "Pending Shipments" ✅

#### Test 3: Location Filtering
1. Login as user with access to only Location A
2. Create Transfer A: Location A → Location B
3. Create Transfer B: Location C → Location D
4. Go to `/dashboard`
5. **Expected**:
   - Transfer A is VISIBLE ✅
   - Transfer B is NOT visible ✅

#### Test 4: Multiple Pending Transfers
1. Create 5 pending transfers with different statuses
2. Go to `/dashboard`
3. **Expected**: All 5 transfers appear in the list ✅

### Database Verification

Check pending transfers in database:

```sql
-- View all pending transfers for a business
SELECT
  id,
  transfer_number,
  status,
  from_location_id,
  to_location_id,
  created_at
FROM stock_transfers
WHERE business_id = 1
  AND status NOT IN ('completed', 'cancelled')
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Prisma Schema Relations

**StockTransfer Model** (`prisma/schema.prisma`):
```prisma
model StockTransfer {
  id             Int @id @default(autoincrement())
  businessId     Int @map("business_id")

  fromLocationId Int @map("from_location_id")
  toLocationId   Int @map("to_location_id")

  transferNumber String @unique
  transferDate   DateTime
  status         String @default("draft")

  // Relations - THESE ARE CORRECT ✅
  fromLocation   BusinessLocation @relation("TransfersFrom", fields: [fromLocationId], references: [id])
  toLocation     BusinessLocation @relation("TransfersTo", fields: [toLocationId], references: [id])

  items          StockTransferItem[]

  // ... other fields
}
```

### Query Performance

**Index Usage**:
- `businessId` - Indexed for fast business filtering
- `status` - Filtering on status column
- `fromLocationId` / `toLocationId` - Indexed for location queries
- `createdAt` - Used for sorting (DESC)

**Query Optimization**:
- Only selects necessary location fields (`name`)
- Limits results to 10 items
- Uses indexed fields in WHERE clause

## 🚨 Important Notes

### 1. Permission Requirements

Users must have the following permission to see this section:
- `STOCK_TRANSFER_VIEW` permission

**Dashboard Code** (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` line 478):
```tsx
{can(PERMISSIONS.STOCK_TRANSFER_VIEW) && (
  <Card>
    <CardHeader>
      <CardTitle>Pending Shipments</CardTitle>
    </CardHeader>
    // ...
  </Card>
)}
```

### 2. Location Access is Enforced

- Users without `ACCESS_ALL_LOCATIONS` permission will only see transfers related to their assigned locations
- This maintains multi-tenant security and data isolation
- Prevents users from seeing transfers outside their scope of responsibility

### 3. Real-time Updates

The dashboard fetches fresh data on every load. To see updated pending shipments:
- Refresh the dashboard page
- Or navigate away and back to `/dashboard`
