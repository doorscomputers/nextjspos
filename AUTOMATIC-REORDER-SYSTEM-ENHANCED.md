# Automatic Reorder System - Enhanced

## Overview

The automatic reorder system has been significantly enhanced to address real-world warehouse management scenarios. The system now provides intelligent, company-wide inventory replenishment suggestions based on aggregated sales data across all locations.

---

## Key Enhancements Implemented

### 1. ✅ Company-Wide Sales Aggregation

**Problem Solved:** Previously, the system only considered sales from individual locations, which didn't reflect the true demand across the entire business.

**Solution:** The system now:
- Aggregates sales from **ALL locations** (Main Warehouse + All Branches)
- Calculates average daily sales velocity across the entire company
- Provides location-specific breakdowns showing stock and sales per location
- Determines reorder needs based on total company demand

**Business Impact:**
- More accurate reorder recommendations
- Prevents overstocking at individual locations
- Ensures Main Warehouse can fulfill transfers to all branches

---

### 2. ✅ Products Without Suppliers Visibility

**Problem Solved:** Products without assigned suppliers were hidden from the suggestions page, making it impossible to know they needed reordering.

**Solution:**
- **All products needing reorder are now shown**, regardless of supplier status
- Products without suppliers are highlighted in **yellow** with a "No Supplier" badge
- A warning card displays the count of products needing supplier assignment
- Checkboxes are disabled for these products (cannot generate PO until supplier is assigned)

**Visual Indicators:**
- Yellow background row
- "No Supplier" badge next to product name
- Yellow warning card at the top showing count
- "Assign Supplier" button in Action column

---

### 3. ✅ Quick Supplier Assignment Feature

**Problem Solved:** Warehouse managers had to navigate away from the suggestions page to assign suppliers, disrupting the reorder workflow.

**Solution:**
- **"Assign Supplier" button** directly on each product row (for products without suppliers)
- Modal dialog with supplier dropdown
- Instant assignment without leaving the page
- Automatic refresh of suggestions after assignment

**Workflow:**
1. See product with "No Supplier" in yellow
2. Click "Assign Supplier" button
3. Select supplier from dropdown
4. Product is immediately ready for PO generation

---

## How It Works: User Perspective

### For Warehouse Managers (Main Warehouse)

**Step 1: Access Suggestions**
- Navigate to: `/dashboard/purchases/suggestions`
- System automatically analyzes all products with sales history

**Step 2: Review Suggestions**
- View products sorted by urgency:
  - **Critical** (< 3 days stock) - Red
  - **High** (3-7 days stock) - Orange
  - **Medium** (7-14 days stock) - Yellow
  - **Low** (> 14 days) - Blue

**Step 3: Handle Products Without Suppliers**
- Yellow-highlighted rows show products needing supplier assignment
- Click "Assign Supplier" button
- Select appropriate supplier
- Product becomes available for PO generation

**Step 4: Generate Purchase Orders**
- Select products with suppliers (checkboxes enabled)
- Click "Generate Purchase Orders"
- Choose delivery location (typically Main Warehouse)
- Set expected delivery days
- System creates one PO per supplier automatically

## Technical Implementation

### API Route: `/api/purchases/suggestions/route.ts`

**Key Changes:**

```typescript
// BEFORE: Only specific location stock
const currentStock = variation.variationLocationDetails.reduce(...)

// AFTER: ALL locations company-wide
const allLocationStocks = await prisma.variationLocationDetails.findMany({
  where: { productVariationId: variation.id },
  include: { location: { select: { id: true, name: true } } }
})
```

```typescript
// BEFORE: Sales filtered by location
const salesData = await prisma.salesLine.findMany({
  where: {
    productVariationId: variation.id,
    sale: {
      businessId,
      locationId: parseInt(locationId) // ❌ Location-specific
    }
  }
})

// AFTER: Sales from ALL locations
const salesData = await prisma.salesLine.findMany({
  where: {
    productVariationId: variation.id,
    sale: {
      businessId,
      createdAt: { gte: thirtyDaysAgo },
      status: { in: ['completed', 'final'] },
      // ✅ NO location filter - company-wide
    }
  },
  select: {
    quantity: true,
    sale: { select: { locationId: true } }
  }
})
```

```typescript
// NEW: Include products without suppliers
suggestions.push({
  ...otherFields,
  supplierId: variation.supplierId,
  supplierName: variation.supplier?.name || 'No Supplier',
  hasSupplier: !!variation.supplierId, // ✅ Flag for UI
})
```

### New API Route: `/api/products/variations/[id]/assign-supplier/route.ts`

**Purpose:** Allow quick supplier assignment from suggestions page

**Endpoint:** `PATCH /api/products/variations/[id]/assign-supplier`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "supplierId": 123
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "variationId": 456,
    "supplierId": 123,
    "supplierName": "ABC Supplier Co."
  }
}
```

**Security:**
- Validates session authentication
- Verifies product variation belongs to user's business
- Verifies supplier belongs to user's business
- Enforces multi-tenant isolation

---

## UI/UX Enhancements

### Suggestions Page: `/dashboard/purchases/suggestions/page.tsx`

**1. Warning Card (New)**
- Displays only when products without suppliers exist
- Shows count of products needing suppliers
- Yellow styling to match row highlighting

- Button styling: `border-yellow-500 text-yellow-700 hover:bg-yellow-50`

**4. Assign Supplier Modal**
- Clean dialog with supplier dropdown
- Pre-populated supplier list
- Loading state during assignment
- Success toast notification
- Automatic page refresh after assignment

## Urgency Calculation

The system categorizes products by urgency based on "days until stockout":

```
Days Until Stockout = Current Stock ÷ Avg Daily Sales

Urgency Levels:
┌──────────────┬─────────────────┬────────┐
│ Days Left    │ Urgency Level   │ Color  │
├──────────────┼─────────────────┼────────┤
│ < 3 days     │ CRITICAL        │ Red    │
│ 3-7 days     │ HIGH            │ Orange │
│ 7-14 days    │ MEDIUM          │ Yellow │
│ > 14 days    │ LOW             │ Blue   │
└──────────────┴─────────────────┴────────┘
```

---

## Configuration: Product Settings

When adding/editing a product, configure these fields:

### Automatic Reorder Settings

| Field | Description | Default | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `enableAutoReorder` | Enable automatic suggestions | `false` | `true` |
| `reorderPoint` | Stock level to trigger reorder | Auto-calculated | 100 units |
| `reorderQuantity` | How much to order | Auto-calculated | 200 units |
| `leadTimeDays` | Supplier delivery time | `7` | 5 days |
| `safetyStockDays` | Buffer stock days | `3` | 3 days |

### Auto-Calculation Formula

If not manually set:

```typescript
reorderPoint = avgDailySales × (leadTimeDays + safetyStockDays)
reorderQuantity = avgDailySales × (leadTimeDays + safetyStockDays) × 2
```

**Example:**
- Avg Daily Sales: 10 units
- Lead Time: 7 days
- Safety Stock: 3 days

```
reorderPoint = 10 × (7 + 3) = 100 units
reorderQuantity = 10 × (7 + 3) × 2 = 200 units
```
