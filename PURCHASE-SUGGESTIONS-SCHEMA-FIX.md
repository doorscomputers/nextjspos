# Purchase Suggestions Schema Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## Issue Resolved

**Error:** "Error fetching suggestions: Error: Failed to fetch suggestions"

**Root Cause:** The automatic reorder suggestions API was trying to access `variation.supplierId` and `variation.supplier` fields on the `ProductVariation` model, but these fields didn't exist in the Prisma schema.

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Schema Changes**

Added supplier relationship to `ProductVariation` model:

```prisma
model ProductVariation {
  // ... existing fields

  // Supplier relationship for automatic reordering
  supplierId Int?      @map("supplier_id")
  supplier   Supplier? @relation(fields: [supplierId], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull)

  // ... rest of model

  @@index([supplierId])
}
```

Added reverse relation to `Supplier` model:

```prisma
model Supplier {
  // ... existing relations
  productVariations ProductVariation[]
}
```

### 2. **Database Migration**

Ran `npx prisma db push` to sync the database with the new schema.

---

## What This Enables

3. **Enable Supplier Assignment** - "Assign Supplier" button for quick supplier linking
4. **Generate Purchase Orders** - Create POs only for products with assigned suppliers
