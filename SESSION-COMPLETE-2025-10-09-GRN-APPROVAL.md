# Session Complete - GRN Approval System - October 9, 2025

## ✅ All Issues Resolved

### Issue 1: GRN Creation Failed
**Problem**: Missing `supplierId` field in PurchaseReceipt.create()
**Solution**: Added `supplierId: purchase.supplierId` to receipt data
**File**: `src/app/api/purchases/[id]/receive/route.ts` (line 224)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED - GRN-202510-0001 created successfully

### Issue 2: GRN Detail Page "Receipt not found"
**Problem**: User model field `name` doesn't exist
**Solution**: Changed to use `firstName`, `lastName`, `surname`
**File**: `src/app/api/purchases/receipts/[id]/route.ts` (lines 126-130)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

### Issue 3: GRN Detail Page Display Names
**Problem**: TypeScript interface and display code using `user.name`
**Solution**: Updated interface and added `getFullName()` helper function
**File**: `src/app/dashboard/purchases/receipts/[id]/page.tsx`
**Status**: ✅ FIXED
