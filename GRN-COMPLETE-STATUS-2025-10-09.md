- Enters quantities for each item
- Can include serial numbers for serialized items
- **NO inventory update happens yet**
- GRN status: `pending`

### Step 2: Approver Reviews and Approves
- Approver with `purchase.receipt.approve` permission reviews the GRN
- Verifies quantities and items are correct
- Clicks "Approve" button
- **Inventory is NOW updated**
- Stock is added to the location
- Purchase order status is updated
- Accounts payable is created
- GRN status: `approved`
