# Inventory Ledger Fix - Quick Summary

## Problem
Inventory Transaction Ledger showed false -48 unit discrepancy when using custom date ranges with no transactions in the selected period.

## Root Cause
Opening balance was set to 0 when users provided custom start dates, ignoring all historical transactions before that date.

## Solution
Implemented automatic opening balance calculation from all transactions before the custom start date.

## Results

| Metric | Before | After | Status |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Opening Balance | 0 | 50 | ✅ FIXED |
| Closing Balance | 0 | 50 | ✅ FIXED |
| System Inventory | 48 | 50 | ✅ Matches |
| Discrepancy | -48 | 0 | ✅ RECONCILED |

## Files Modified
1. `src/app/api/reports/inventory-ledger/route.ts` - Added opening balance calculation logic
2. `src/app/dashboard/reports/inventory-ledger/page.tsx` - Added user-friendly notices

## Testing
Test script: `test-ledger-fix.js`
Result: ✅ All tests pass, discrepancy = 0 units

## Status
**COMPLETE** - Ready for production deployment
