## ‚ùì Common Questions & Answers

### Q: "I don't see the Accounting menu"
**A**: You need `ACCOUNTING_ACCESS` permission. Make sure you're logged in as Super Admin.

### Q: "Chart of Accounts already initialized"
**A**: That's fine! It means Step 2 is complete. Skip to entering transactions.

### Q: "Entry is not balanced"
**A**: Your debits don't equal your credits. Double-check your numbers. Every debit must have an equal credit.

### Q: "Trial Balance shows UNBALANCED"
**A**: There's an error in one of your journal entries. Review each entry to find where debits ‚â† credits.

### Q: "Balance Sheet shows all zeros"
**A**: You haven't entered any transactions yet. Follow the tutorial to enter beginning balances and transactions.

### Q: "How do I know if it's working?"
**A**: After entering the sample transactions from the tutorial:
- Balance Sheet should show your assets, liabilities, and equity
- Income Statement should calculate profit or loss
- Trial Balance should show "‚úÖ BALANCED"
- All reports should have educational tooltips

## üéì Learning Resources

### In the System
Every report has built-in help:
- **"What is this?" button** - Explains the whole report
- **Hover tooltips** - Explain each field
- **Color indicators** - Green = good, Red = problem
- **Smart messages** - Interpret your results

### Key Concepts (Simplified)

**Assets = Liabilities + Equity**
- This ALWAYS balances
- If not, there's an error

**Profit = Revenue - Expenses**
- Positive = You made money
- Negative = You lost money
- Zero = Break even

**Debits = Credits**
- Every transaction must balance
- Debits on left, Credits on right
- Not about "good" or "bad"

**Cash ‚â† Profit**
- You can have profit but no cash (customers haven't paid)
- You can have cash but no profit (took a loan)
- Both reports are important!

## üîÑ Integration with Existing System

### Automatic Accounting Entries

Your POS transactions automatically create accounting entries:

**When you make a sale**:
```
Debit: Cash (or Accounts Receivable)
Credit: Sales Revenue
Debit: Cost of Goods Sold
Credit: Inventory
```

**When you purchase inventory**:
```
Debit: Inventory
Credit: Accounts Payable
```

**No manual entry needed for normal operations!**

The tutorial shows you how to:
- Enter beginning balances (one-time setup)
- Record special transactions (like rent, loans)
- Adjust for errors (if needed)
