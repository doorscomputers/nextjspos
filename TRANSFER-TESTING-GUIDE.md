## What If You Want to Test Real Separation of Duties?

If you want to see the **full separation of duties enforcement**, you need 6 different users:

1. **User 1 (jheirone)**: Create transfer
2. **User 2 (mainmgr)**: Approve transfer
3. **User 3**: Send transfer
4. **User 4**: Mark as arrived
5. **User 5**: Start verification & verify items
6. **User 6**: Complete transfer

To create additional users, go to "Users" menu and create new accounts with appropriate roles.

## Verification Checklist

After completing the workflow, verify:

- ‚úÖ Transfer status shows "Completed"
- ‚úÖ Stock deducted from Main Warehouse (check Products page)
- ‚úÖ Stock added to Tugusarao location (check Products page)
- ‚úÖ "Workflow Audit Trail" section shows all participants
- ‚úÖ Each stage has username and timestamp
- ‚úÖ Transfer is immutable (no action buttons visible)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Approve" button doesn't show
**Reason**: You're logged in as jheirone (the creator)
**Solution**: Log in as mainmgr or superadmin

### Problem: "Send Transfer" button doesn't show
**Reason**: Either you don't have SEND permission, OR you're the creator/checker
**Solution**: Log in as a different user with Branch Manager or Branch Admin role

### Problem: Can't mark as arrived
**Reason**: You might be the creator, checker, or sender
**Solution**: Log in as superadmin or a user at destination location

### Problem: Items won't verify
**Reason**: You haven't clicked "Start Verification" first
**Solution**: Click "Start Verification" button, THEN verify each item

### Problem: Can't complete transfer
**Reason**: Not all items verified yet, OR you're the creator/sender
**Solution**: Verify ALL items first, then log in as different user

---

## Next Steps After Completion

Once transfer is completed:

1. ‚úÖ Check "All Transfers" page - Status should show "Completed"
2. ‚úÖ Go to "Products" page - Verify stock quantities at both locations
3. ‚úÖ Go to "Audit Logs" page - See complete activity trail
4. ‚úÖ Print transfer document for records

---

## Additional Notes

- **Cancellation**: You can cancel the transfer at ANY stage before "Arrived" by clicking "Cancel Transfer" button
- **Stock Restoration**: If you cancel during "In Transit", stock will be automatically restored to Main Warehouse
- **Cannot Cancel After Arrival**: Once goods arrive at destination, cancellation is not allowed (must use Return process instead)
