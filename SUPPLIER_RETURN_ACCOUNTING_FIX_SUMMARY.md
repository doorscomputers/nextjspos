# Supplier Return Accounting Investigation - Executive Summary

## The Problem (In Simple Terms)

When we returned **1 unit of ADATA 512GB 2.5 SSD** to **GRAND TECH** on **October 21, 2025**:

✅ **What DID Happen:**
- Inventory was reduced by 1 unit (CORRECT)
- Stock records were updated (CORRECT)

❌ **What DID NOT Happen:**
- We still owe GRAND TECH the full amount (₱24,520)
- The system did NOT reduce what we owe by ₱1,520
- **We're showing we owe ₱1,520 MORE than we actually do!**

---

## Financial Impact

```
BALANCE SHEET IMPACT:

Assets (Inventory):     -₱1,520  ✅ Correctly reduced
Liabilities (AP):        ₱0      ❌ Should be -₱1,520

NET EFFECT: We're understating our net worth by ₱1,520
```

**What this means:**
- Our books show we owe GRAND TECH ₱24,520
- We actually only owe ₱23,000
- If we pay all invoices as shown, we'll OVERPAY by ₱1,520

---

## The Root Cause

The supplier return approval code (`src/app/api/supplier-returns/[id]/approve/route.ts`) does this:

```typescript
// CURRENT CODE (Lines 76-94)
for (const item of supplierReturn.items) {
  await processSupplierReturn({
    // ... deducts inventory
  })
}

// ❌ MISSING: No code to reduce Accounts Payable
// ❌ MISSING: No Payment/Credit record created
// ❌ MISSING: No journal entry posted
```

**Why it wasn't noticed before:**
- Inventory managers see stock is correct
- Accounting team doesn't review supplier returns daily
- No automated validation checks balance sheet after returns
- Reports don't flag AP discrepancies from returns

---

## The Fix (Three Steps)

### Step 1: Fix Current Transaction (Immediate)

**Run this script:**
```bash
node fix-supplier-return-sr-202510-0001.mjs
```

This will:
1. Apply ₱1,520 credit to invoice PO-202510-0001
2. Mark that invoice as "paid"
3. Create a Payment record showing "supplier_return_credit"
4. Balance the books

**Time Required:** 2 minutes
**Risk Level:** Low (read the script first, it's safe)

### Step 2: Prevent Future Issues (Critical)

**Modify:** `src/app/api/supplier-returns/[id]/approve/route.ts`

**Add this code after line 133 (inside the transaction, after stock deduction):**

```typescript
// CRITICAL: Update Accounts Payable for the return
const apEntries = await tx.accountsPayable.findMany({
  where: {
    supplierId: supplierReturn.supplierId,
    businessId: businessIdNumber,
    balanceAmount: { gt: 0 }
  },
  orderBy: { invoiceDate: 'asc' }
})

if (apEntries.length > 0) {
  let remainingCredit = parseFloat(supplierReturn.totalAmount.toString())

  for (const ap of apEntries) {
    if (remainingCredit <= 0) break

    const currentBalance = parseFloat(ap.balanceAmount.toString())
    const creditToApply = Math.min(remainingCredit, currentBalance)
    const newPaidAmount = parseFloat(ap.paidAmount.toString()) + creditToApply
    const newBalance = currentBalance - creditToApply
    const newStatus = newBalance === 0 ? 'paid' :
                      newBalance < parseFloat(ap.totalAmount.toString()) ? 'partial' :
                      'unpaid'

    await tx.accountsPayable.update({
      where: { id: ap.id },
      data: {
        paidAmount: newPaidAmount,
        balanceAmount: newBalance,
        paymentStatus: newStatus
      }
    })

    remainingCredit -= creditToApply
  }

  // Create payment record for audit trail
  await tx.payment.create({
    data: {
      businessId: businessIdNumber,
      supplierId: supplierReturn.supplierId,
      amount: parseFloat(supplierReturn.totalAmount.toString()),
      paymentDate: supplierReturn.returnDate,
      paymentMethod: 'supplier_return_credit',
      referenceNumber: supplierReturn.returnNumber,
      status: 'completed',
      notes: `Credit from supplier return ${supplierReturn.returnNumber} - ${supplierReturn.returnReason}`,
      createdBy: userIdNumber
    }
  })
}
```

**Time Required:** 15 minutes
**Risk Level:** Medium (test thoroughly)

### Step 3: Add Validation (Recommended)

**Add after the AP updates:**

```typescript
// Verify balance sheet is balanced
const inventoryReduction = parseFloat(supplierReturn.totalAmount.toString())
const apReduction = apEntries.reduce((sum, ap) => {
  const oldBalance = parseFloat(ap.balanceAmount.toString())
  // Recalculate what new balance would be
  return sum + (oldBalance - parseFloat(ap.balanceAmount.toString()))
}, 0)

if (Math.abs(inventoryReduction - apReduction) > 0.01) {
  throw new Error(
    `Balance sheet validation failed: ` +
    `Inventory reduced by ₱${inventoryReduction} but AP only reduced by ₱${apReduction}`
  )
}
```

**Time Required:** 5 minutes
**Risk Level:** Low (safety check)

## Testing Checklist

After implementing the fix, test these scenarios:

- [ ] Create a purchase for ₱1,000 to a supplier
- [ ] Return all items (₱1,000 return)
- [ ] Verify AP balance becomes ₱0
- [ ] Verify payment_status changes to 'paid'
- [ ] Verify Payment record is created with method 'supplier_return_credit'
- [ ] Check that inventory is reduced
- [ ] Verify ProductHistory shows the return
- [ ] Test partial return (return ₱500 of a ₱1,000 purchase)
- [ ] Test return when supplier has multiple invoices
- [ ] Test return when supplier has no outstanding AP (should create credit)

## Quick Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Action Required | Urgency |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| **Have existing supplier returns?** | Run investigation script to find them | High |
| **Found unbalanced returns?** | Run fix script for each | High |
| **Want to prevent future issues?** | Implement Step 2 code changes | Critical |
| **Need audit trail?** | Implement Step 3 validation | Medium |
| **Preparing for audit?** | Read full forensic report | High |

## Expected Questions & Answers

**Q: How did this happen?**
A: The supplier return approval code was only designed to handle inventory, not accounting. It's a missing feature, not a bug.

**Q: Is our data corrupted?**
A: No. Inventory data is 100% correct. Only the Accounts Payable balances are incorrect (overstated).

**Q: Can we just manually adjust AP?**
A: You could, but then there's no audit trail. The fix script creates proper Payment records.

**Q: Will this happen again?**
A: Yes, unless you implement Step 2. Every future supplier return will have this issue.

**Q: What about returns we already processed?**
A: Run `find-supplier-returns.mjs` to find them, then run the fix script for each.

**Q: Does this affect taxes?**
A: Potentially yes. Overstated AP could affect financial ratios. Consult your accountant.

**Q: Is this a critical bug?**
A: It's a critical MISSING FEATURE. The system works correctly for what it was designed to do (inventory), but was never designed to handle the accounting side.
