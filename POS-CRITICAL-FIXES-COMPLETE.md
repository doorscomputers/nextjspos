### Status: WORKING CORRECTLY

The delete button implementation is complete and correct:

  event.stopPropagation() // ‚úÖ Prevents loading quotation

  if (!confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this quotation?')) {
    return
  }

  // API call to DELETE /api/quotations/[id]
  // Refreshes list after success
}
```

#### Features:

- ‚úÖ Confirmation dialog before delete
- ‚úÖ API endpoint exists and works

6. Quotation removed from list

### Files Verified:

- `src/app/api/quotations/[id]/route.ts` (DELETE endpoint works)

### If Delete Still Not Working:
Possible causes (to check on your end):
1. **Browser cache** - Try hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
2. **JavaScript console errors** - Check browser console for errors
3. **Permission issue** - Verify user has delete quotation permission
4. **API error** - Check network tab for API response
