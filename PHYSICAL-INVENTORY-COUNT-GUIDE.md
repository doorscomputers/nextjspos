## üìù Best Practices

### For Inventory Managers

1. **Export Fresh Data**
   - Always export immediately before physical count
   - Use the most current data

2. **Count Accurately**
   - Take time to count carefully
   - Double-check high-value items
   - Leave blank if unsure (don't guess)

3. **Import Promptly**
   - Upload filled Excel as soon as counting is complete
   - Don't delay - stock may change

4. **Review Before Approval**
   - Check large differences carefully
   - Investigate unexpected variances
   - Add remarks explaining discrepancies

### For Developers

1. **Performance**
   - Process imports in database transactions
   - Use bulk operations where possible
   - Limit Excel file size (recommend < 10,000 rows)

2. **Error Handling**
   - Validate thoroughly before processing
   - Provide clear error messages
   - Log errors for debugging

3. **Security**
   - Always check permissions
   - Enforce multi-tenant isolation
   - Validate file types

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Data Consistency
- Physical count overwrites system count after approval
- No partial imports - all or nothing per row
- Stock transactions created maintain history

### File Format
- Only `.xlsx` and `.xls` files supported
- First sheet is used if multiple sheets exist
- Column headers must match exactly (case-sensitive)

### Permissions
- Users need location access to export/import for that location
- Branch Managers have limited location access
- Branch Admins have all location access

### Performance Considerations
- Large files (>5,000 items) may take longer to process
- Consider splitting very large inventories by location
- Import processes items sequentially for data integrity

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Export returns empty file
**Solution**: No products exist at selected location. Add products to location first.

### Issue: Import fails with "Location not found"
**Solution**: Ensure you select the same location for import as you used for export.

### Issue: Import skips all items
**Solution**: Physical Count column is empty or matches system count. Fill in actual counts.

### Issue: Permission denied
**Solution**: Contact admin to grant PHYSICAL_INVENTORY_EXPORT or PHYSICAL_INVENTORY_IMPORT permission.

### Issue: Validation errors
**Solution**: Check that Product IDs and Variation IDs haven't been modified in Excel file.
