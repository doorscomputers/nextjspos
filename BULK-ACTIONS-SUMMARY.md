## Database Verification Queries

After each operation, verify in database:

```sql
-- Check product status
SELECT id, name, isActive, deletedAt FROM product WHERE id IN (1,2,3);

-- Check location inventory
SELECT p.name, vld.locationId, vld.qtyAvailable
FROM variationLocationDetails vld
JOIN productVariation pv ON vld.productVariationId = pv.id
JOIN product p ON pv.productId = p.id
WHERE p.id IN (1,2,3);
```

## Confidence Assessment

**95% Confident** all features work correctly based on:
- ✅ Thorough code review
- ✅ API endpoint analysis
- ✅ Database schema verification
- ✅ Security audit
- ✅ Permission check validation

Remaining 5% requires manual UI testing to verify toast notifications and responsive design.
