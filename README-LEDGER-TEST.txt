QUICK START (Choose One)
================================================================================

OPTION 1: AUTOMATED (RECOMMENDED)
----------------------------------
Windows PowerShell:
  .\run-ledger-test.ps1

Linux/Mac Bash:
  chmod +x run-ledger-test.sh
  ./run-ledger-test.sh

The script will:
  1. Check prerequisites
  2. Run cleanup (with confirmation)
  3. Execute Playwright test
  4. Show results


OPTION 2: MANUAL STEP-BY-STEP
------------------------------
Step 1: Start dev server (keep running)
  npm run dev

Step 2: Clean all transactions
  node cleanup-all-transactions.js
  (Confirm with: DELETE ALL TRANSACTIONS)

Step 3: Verify clean state
  node check-db.js
  (Should show: Total: 0)

Step 4: Run Playwright test
  npx playwright test e2e/inventory-ledger-full-flow.spec.ts --headed

Step 5: View results
  npx playwright show-report


WHAT THE TEST DOES
================================================================================

Transaction Flow (7 Steps):
  1. Opening Inventory: 100 units (Inventory Correction)
  2. Purchase Receipt: +50 units = 150 total
  3. Sale: -20 units = 130 total
  4. Transfer Out: -30 units = 100 total
  5. Transfer In: +15 units = 115 total
  6. Inventory Correction: -5 units = 110 total
  7. Verify Ledger Report: Check all balances

Edge Cases:
  - Empty date range (no transactions)
  - Partial date range (subset of transactions)

SUCCESS CRITERIA
================================================================================

MUST PASS:
  [x] All 8 test cases pass
  [x] Opening Balance: 100 units
  [x] Closing Balance: 110 units
  [x] System Inventory: 110 units
  [x] Variance: 0 units (CRITICAL!)
  [x] Status: "Matched"
  [x] All 5+ transactions appear
  [x] Running balances correct
  [x] Screenshots generated


WHAT GETS CLEANED
================================================================================

DELETED (Transactional Data):
  - Purchase Orders & Receipts
  - Sales Transactions
  - Stock Transfers
  - Inventory Corrections
  - Returns (Purchase & Customer)
  - Serial Numbers
  - Bank Transactions
  - Accounts Payable & Payments
  - Cashier Shifts & Readings
  - Audit Logs (optional)

PRESERVED (Master Data):
  - Users, Roles, Permissions
  - Business, Locations
  - Products, Variations
  - Suppliers, Customers
  - Categories, Brands
  - Tax Rates, Payment Methods


TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Problem: "Database connection failed"
Solution: Check if MySQL/PostgreSQL is running
          Verify .env has correct DATABASE_URL

Problem: "Product not found"
Solution: Run: npm run db:seed

Problem: "Dev server not running"
Solution: Run: npm run dev (keep it running)

Problem: "Timeout errors"
Solution: Increase timeout or run in headless mode

Problem: "Discrepancy still showing"
Solution: 1. Run cleanup again
          2. Verify clean state (check-db.js)
          3. Check for background jobs
          4. Review API logs


IMPORTANT NOTES
================================================================================

WARNING: Cleanup deletes ALL transactions permanently!
  - Cannot be undone
  - Make sure you have backups if running on production data
  - Safe on development/test environments

Test Duration:
  - Cleanup: 5-10 seconds
  - Test Execution: 3-5 minutes
  - Total: 6-8 minutes

Test Environment:
  - User: superadmin / password
  - Product: Generic Mouse (from seed)
  - Location: Main Warehouse (ID: 1)
  - Database: Real database (not mocks)


WHAT THIS PROVES
================================================================================

100% Ledger Accuracy:
  [x] All transaction types tracked correctly
  [x] Running balance calculation accurate
  [x] Opening balance logic works
  [x] Closing balance matches system inventory
  [x] Zero variance = perfect reconciliation

Transaction Processing:
  [x] Purchase receipts update inventory
  [x] Sales decrease inventory
  [x] Transfers move inventory
  [x] Corrections adjust inventory
  [x] All updates atomic and consistent

Report Functionality:
  [x] Date range filtering works
  [x] Custom ranges calculate opening balance
  [x] Empty ranges handled gracefully
  [x] Transactions chronologically ordered
  [x] Running balance recalculation correct
