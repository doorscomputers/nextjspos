5. **Comparison Views**
   - Compare with previous period
   - Year-over-year comparison

6. **Customizable Widgets**

## Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "recharts": "^2.x.x"
}
```

## Files Modified/Created

1. ✅ `src/app/api/dashboard/stats/route.ts` - Created
2. ✅ `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Replaced
3. ✅ `comprehensive-test.js` - Fixed schema errors
4. ✅ `DASHBOARD-IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Created (this file)

## Performance Considerations

- Data is fetched on location filter change only
- Loading states prevent UI flicker
- Charts use lightweight Recharts library
- Tables limited to 10 rows each for performance
- Proper indexing on database queries

## Next Steps

1. **Manual UI Testing**
   - Follow TESTING-CHECKLIST.md
   - Test all dashboard features
   - Verify responsiveness on different devices
   - Test with different user roles

2. **Production Considerations**
   - Add error boundaries
   - Implement proper error messages
   - Add data refresh intervals
   - Consider caching strategy

3. **User Training**
   - Create user guide
   - Document dashboard features
   - Explain metrics and reports
