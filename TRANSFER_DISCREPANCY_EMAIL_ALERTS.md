# Transfer Discrepancy Email Alerts

## Overview

Your UltimatePOS system now automatically sends email notifications to administrators and the business owner when inventory discrepancies are detected during transfer verification. This critical security feature helps prevent theft, identify shipping errors, and maintain inventory accuracy.

---

## üéØ When Alerts Are Sent

An email alert is automatically triggered when:

1. ‚úÖ **All items** in a transfer have been verified
2. ‚úÖ At least **one item** has a quantity discrepancy (sent ‚â† received)
3. ‚úÖ Email notifications are **enabled** in configuration

The system sends **ONE consolidated email** with all discrepancies, rather than multiple emails per item.

---

## üìß Who Receives the Alerts

**Recipients:**
1. **Admin Email (Fixed):** `rr3800@gmail.com` (configured in `EMAIL_ADMIN_RECIPIENTS`)
2. **Business Email:** The email address associated with the business (stored in database)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending?

**Check:**

2. ‚úÖ `EMAIL_ALERT_TRANSFER_DISCREPANCY_ENABLED=true`
3. ‚úÖ SMTP credentials are correct
4. ‚úÖ Gmail app password (not regular password)
5. ‚úÖ Check console logs for errors
6. ‚úÖ Verify business email is set in database

### Test with Command:
```bash
# Check console output
node -e "console.log(process.env.EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED)"
node -e "console.log(process.env.SMTP_USER)"
```

### Common Issues:

**"Email not configured"**
- Missing SMTP settings in `.env`
- Solution: Add all required SMTP variables

**"Authentication failed"**
- Using regular password instead of app password
- Solution: Generate Gmail app password

**"No email received"**
- Check spam/junk folder
- Verify `EMAIL_ADMIN_RECIPIENTS` is correct
- Check business email in database

---

## üíæ Database Requirement

The system fetches the business email from the `Business` table. Ensure your business has an email configured:

```sql
-- Check business email
SELECT id, name, email FROM "businesses" WHERE id = 1;

-- Update business email if needed
UPDATE "businesses" SET email = 'owner@company.com' WHERE id = 1;
```

---

## üìù Audit Trail

Every discrepancy email is automatically logged:

1. **StockTransfer** - Marked with `hasDiscrepancy = true`
2. **StockTransferItem** - Each item stores `hasDiscrepancy`, `discrepancyNotes`
3. **AuditLog** - Records verification with discrepancy metadata
4. **Email Logs** - Console logs email send status
