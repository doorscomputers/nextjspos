All improvements maintain full dark mode compatibility and follow ShadCN UI best practices.

## Before & After Pattern Example

### Before:
```tsx
<Button onClick={handleSubmit} className="w-full mt-4" size="lg">
  Complete Sale
</Button>
```

### After:
```tsx
<Button
  onClick={handleSubmit}
  className="w-full mt-4 shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl transition-all duration-200 hover:scale-105 font-semibold"
  size="lg"
>
  Complete Sale
</Button>
```

### Key Additions:

2. `transition-all duration-200` - Smooth animations
3. `hover:scale-105` - Interactive feedback
4. `font-semibold` - Better text hierarchy

For primary/accent buttons, gradient treatment:
```tsx
<Button
  className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-600 to-blue-500 hover:from-blue-700 hover:to-blue-600 shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl transition-all duration-200 hover:scale-105 font-semibold"

  Primary Action
</Button>
```

   - Verify button wrapping behavior

3. **Functionality Testing**:
   - Ensure all button click handlers still work
   - Verify modals open/close correctly
   - Test form submissions
   - Verify navigation buttons

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Check for any layout shift during hover
   - Ensure animations don't cause jank
