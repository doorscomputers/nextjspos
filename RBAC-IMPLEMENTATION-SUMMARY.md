## Permission Groups

Permissions are organized into the following functional areas:

1. **Dashboard**: dashboard.view
2. **Users**: user.view, user.create, user.update, user.delete
3. **Roles**: role.view, role.create, role.update, role.delete
4. **Products**: product.*, including view_purchase_price, opening_stock, etc.
5. **Sales**: sell.view, sell.create, sell.update, sell.delete, sell.view_own
6. **Purchases**: purchase.*
7. **Expenses**: expense.*
8. **Customers**: customer.*
9. **Suppliers**: supplier.*
10. **Reports**: report.view, report.profit_loss, report.purchase_sell, report.stock.view
11. **Business Settings**: business_settings.view, business_settings.edit
12. **Locations**: location.*, access_all_locations
13. **Super Admin**: superadmin.*, for platform-level management

## Default Roles

The system includes these default roles (defined in `src/lib/rbac.ts`):

1. **Super Admin**: All permissions (platform owner)
2. **Branch Admin**: Full business management permissions
3. **Branch Manager**: Operational permissions without user management
4. **Accounting Staff**: Finance and reporting permissions
5. **Regular Staff**: Basic sales and customer management
6. **Regular Cashier**: Limited to POS operations and viewing own sales

## Usage Instructions

### Accessing User Management
1. Navigate to the sidebar
2. Expand "User Management" menu
3. Click "Users" to manage users
4. Click "Roles & Permissions" to manage roles

### Creating a User
1. Click "Add User" button
2. Fill in required fields (surname, first name, username, password)
3. Select at least one role
4. Optionally assign locations
5. Set max sale discount if needed
6. Click "Create User"

### Editing a User
1. Click the edit (pencil) icon on any user row
2. Modify desired fields
3. Password field is optional (leave blank to keep current)
4. Click "Update User"

### Creating a Role
1. Click "Add Role" button
2. Enter role name
3. Select permissions from grouped list
4. Use group checkboxes to select all permissions in a category
5. Click "Create Role"

### Editing a Role
1. Click the edit icon on a custom role (system roles are protected)
2. Modify role name if needed
3. Adjust permission selections
4. Click "Update Role"

### Viewing Details
- Click the eye icon on any user or role to view full details
- Details dialogs are read-only for quick reference

## Security Considerations

### Password Security
- Passwords hashed using bcrypt with salt rounds
- Never returned in API responses
- Minimum 6 character requirement
- New password required on user creation
- Optional password update (preserves existing if not provided)

### Data Isolation
- All queries filtered by `businessId` from session
- Super Admin bypass for platform management
- Foreign key relationships enforce referential integrity
- Cascade deletes maintain data consistency

### Input Validation
- Client-side validation for UX
- Server-side validation for security
- Zod schemas ensure type safety
- SQL injection prevention via Prisma ORM

### Authorization
- Session-based authentication via NextAuth
- JWT tokens contain user permissions
- Permission checks on all protected routes
- UI elements hidden based on permissions

## API Response Formats

### User List Response
```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "surname": "Doe",
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Smith",
      "username": "johndoe",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "allowLogin": true,
      "maxSaleDiscount": 10.00,
      "business": { "id": 1, "name": "My Business" },
      "roles": [{ "id": 2, "name": "Branch Admin" }],
      "locations": [{ "id": 1, "name": "Main Store" }],
      "createdAt": "2025-10-05T10:30:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 20,
    "total": 50,
    "totalPages": 3
  }
}
```

### Role List Response
```json
{
  "roles": [
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Branch Admin",
      "businessId": 1,
      "isDefault": true,
      "permissions": [
        { "id": 1, "name": "dashboard.view" },
        { "id": 2, "name": "user.view" }
      ],
      "userCount": 5,
      "createdAt": "2025-10-05T10:30:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Error Handling

All API routes return consistent error responses:

```json
{
  "error": "User not found"
}
```

Common error scenarios handled:
- Unauthorized (401): No valid session
- Forbidden (403): Insufficient permissions
- Not Found (404): Resource doesn't exist
- Bad Request (400): Validation errors, duplicate usernames/emails
- Internal Server Error (500): Unexpected errors

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist
1. Create user with single role and multiple locations
2. Create user with multiple roles
3. Edit user and change roles
4. Edit user and update password
5. Delete user with confirmation
6. Search users by username, email, name
7. Filter users by role and location
8. Create custom role with permissions
9. Edit role permissions
10. Attempt to delete role with users (should fail)
11. Attempt to edit/delete default role (should be disabled/fail)
12. Test as different user roles (verify permission-based UI)
13. Test mobile responsive layouts

### Permission Testing
- Login as users with different roles
- Verify menu items appear/disappear based on permissions
- Verify API calls are blocked for unauthorized users
- Test cross-business access prevention

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:

1. **Bulk Operations**: Assign role to multiple users at once
2. **User Import/Export**: CSV import for bulk user creation
3. **Audit Log**: Track all user and role changes
4. **Password Policies**: Enforce complexity requirements
5. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Enhanced security
6. **Direct Permissions**: Assign individual permissions to users (not just roles)
7. **Role Cloning**: Duplicate existing role as template
8. **User Activity Log**: Track login history and actions
9. **Email Notifications**: Notify users of account creation/changes
10. **Advanced Filters**: Date ranges, activity status, etc.

## Troubleshooting

### Users not appearing in list
- Check user has correct `businessId`
- Verify user is not soft-deleted (`deletedAt` is null)
- Check session user has `USER_VIEW` permission

### Cannot create user
- Verify username is unique
- Check email is unique (if provided)
- Ensure at least one role is selected
- Verify roles belong to same business

### Cannot delete role
- Ensure role is not a default system role
- Check no users are currently assigned to the role
- Verify user has `ROLE_DELETE` permission

### Permissions not updating
- Session tokens cache permissions on login
- User must logout and login again to see new permissions
- Or invalidate session and force re-authentication

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a production-ready RBAC system with:
- Complete user and role management
- Permission-based access control
- Multi-tenant security
- Responsive, accessible UI
- Comprehensive validation and error handling
- Professional user experience

All components follow Next.js 15 and React 19 best practices with proper TypeScript typing, form validation, and security measures.
