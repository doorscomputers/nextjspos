## Common Patterns & Best Practices Implemented

### ✅ Theme Tokens Used
```tsx
// Typography
text-foreground        // Primary text
text-muted-foreground  // Secondary text
text-destructive       // Errors/required

// Backgrounds
bg-background          // Page background
bg-card               // Card backgrounds
bg-muted              // Muted sections

// Borders
border-border         // Default borders
border-input          // Input borders

// Interactive
ring-ring             // Focus rings
hover:bg-muted/50     // Hover states
```

### ✅ Dark Mode Pattern
```tsx
// Color with dark variant
className="text-green-600 dark:text-green-500"
className="bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-950/30"
className="border-blue-200 dark:border-blue-800"
```

### ✅ Input Fields Pattern
```tsx
className="w-full px-4 py-2 border border-input bg-background text-foreground
           rounded-lg focus:ring-2 focus:ring-ring focus:border-transparent
           transition-colors"
```

### ✅ Table Pattern
```tsx
// Container
<div className="bg-card rounded-lg shadow overflow-hidden border border-border">

  // Table
  <table className="min-w-full divide-y divide-border">

    // Header
    <thead className="bg-muted/50">

    // Body
    <tbody className="bg-card divide-y divide-border">

      // Row
      <tr className="hover:bg-muted/50 transition-colors">
```
