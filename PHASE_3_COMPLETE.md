## üîÑ Deployment Notes

**Prerequisites**:
- Database migrations: None required (uses existing `Sale` table)
- Environment variables: No changes needed
- Dependencies: No new packages added
- Database fields used: `Sale.status = 'voided'`, `Sale.voidReason` (optional)

**Deployment Steps**:
1. Pull latest code from repository
2. Run `npm run build` (verified working ‚úÖ)
3. Restart application server
4. Test with different user roles (cashier, manager, admin)
5. Verify Reports Hub displays both new reports
6. Test hourly sales breakdown calculations
7. Test void tracking with actual voided transactions

**Rollback Plan**:
- Remove report cards from Reports Hub UI (lines 148-165 of page.tsx)
- Revert RBAC permission additions (lines 189-190, 941-943 of rbac.ts)
- No database changes to rollback
- Delete 4 report files if needed

**Data Requirements**:
- Hourly Sales: Requires `Sale` records with valid `saleDate` timestamps
- Void Analysis: Requires `Sale` records with `status = 'voided'`
- Optional: `voidReason` field on `Sale` table for better analysis (currently using type assertion)

## üí° Implementation Insights

### Hourly Sales Report Technical Details:

**Percentile Calculation**:
```typescript
const salesCounts = Object.values(hourlyData).map((d: any) => d.salesCount)
const sortedCounts = [...salesCounts].sort((a, b) => a - b)
const percentile75Index = Math.floor(sortedCounts.length * 0.75)
const busyThreshold = sortedCounts[percentile75Index]
```

**Why This Matters**: Provides statistical rigor rather than arbitrary thresholds. Busy hours are objectively defined as hours with sales >= 75th percentile.

**Hour Formatting**:
```typescript
function formatHour(hour: number): string {
  const period = hour >= 12 ? 'PM' : 'AM'
  const displayHour = hour === 0 ? 12 : hour > 12 ? hour - 12 : hour
  return `${displayHour}:00 ${period}`
}
```

**Visual Bar Chart**:
```typescript
const getHourBarWidth = (count: number) => {
  if (!summary || summary.peakHour.salesCount === 0) return '0%'
  return `${(count / summary.peakHour.salesCount) * 100}%`
}
```

**Why This Matters**: Dynamic width calculation makes peak hours visually obvious at a glance.

### Void Analysis Report Technical Details:

**Void Rate Calculation**:
```typescript
const totalSalesCount = await prisma.sale.count({
  where: totalSalesWhere,
})
const voidRate = totalSalesCount > 0 ? (totalVoids / totalSalesCount) * 100 : 0
```

**Why This Matters**: Critical fraud detection metric. Void rates > 5% typically warrant investigation.

**Reason Tracking**:
```typescript
const reason = (sale as any).voidReason || 'No reason provided'
```

**Why This Matters**: Even if `voidReason` field isn't in Prisma schema yet, graceful fallback ensures report works. Field can be added to schema later.

## üìà Business Intelligence Insights

### Hourly Sales Breakdown Insights:

**Sample Use Cases**:
1. **Restaurant/Cafe**: Identify lunch rush (11 AM - 2 PM) and dinner rush (6 PM - 9 PM)
2. **Retail Store**: Schedule more staff on weekends, reduce during weekday mornings
3. **Pharmacy**: Ensure adequate staff during morning (7-9 AM) and evening (5-7 PM) peaks
4. **Convenience Store**: 24-hour operation can identify slow hours for restocking (2-5 AM)

**Staffing ROI Example**:
- If peak hour has 150 sales, slow hour has 20 sales
- Peak hour needs 3 cashiers, slow hour needs 1 cashier
- Salary savings: 2 cashiers √ó 8 hours √ó ‚Ç±500/day = ‚Ç±8,000/day savings
- Monthly savings: ‚Ç±240,000

### Void Analysis Insights:

**Fraud Detection Patterns**:
1. **Same cashier, multiple voids per shift**: Potential theft (void sale, keep cash)
2. **Voids concentrated at specific hours**: Possible collusion or shift-specific issues
3. **High void rate in specific location**: Training issue or manager not monitoring
4. **Voids without reasons**: Policy violation, lack of accountability

**Normal vs Suspicious Void Rates**:
- **< 1%**: Excellent (normal operational errors)
- **1-3%**: Acceptable (occasional mistakes)
- **3-5%**: Concerning (needs monitoring)
- **> 5%**: Critical (investigate immediately)
