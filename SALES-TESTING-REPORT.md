## üß™ Testing Status

### Automated Tests (Playwright)
**Status:** Test file created, requires debugging

**Issues Found:**
1. Login navigation needs adjustment
2. Sidebar menu expansion may need different selectors
3. Test needs to account for existing data/shifts

**Test File:** `e2e/pos-workflow.spec.ts`

### Manual Testing Checklist

Since automated tests need adjustment, here's your manual testing guide:

#### ‚úÖ Pre-Testing Setup
```bash
# 1. Ensure database is migrated
npm run db:push  # ‚úÖ DONE - Database in sync

# Username: cashier
# Password: password
```

## üîç API Testing (Direct)

You can test the APIs directly without UI:

### Test Shift Creation
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3007/api/shifts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: next-auth.session-token=YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "locationId": 1,
    "beginningCash": 5000,
    "openingNotes": "API test shift"
  }'
```

### Test Getting Open Shifts
```bash
curl http://localhost:3007/api/shifts?status=open \
  -H "Cookie: next-auth.session-token=YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN"
```

### Test X Reading
```bash
curl http://localhost:3007/api/readings/x-reading \
  -H "Cookie: next-auth.session-token=YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN"
```

## üêõ Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue 1: Playwright Tests Timing Out
**Cause:** Tests may be running before app is fully initialized or session is not properly maintained
**Workaround:** Use manual testing for now
**Fix Plan:** Adjust test selectors and add proper wait conditions

### Issue 2: Port Conflict
**Observed:** Server running on port 3007 instead of 3000
**Impact:** Tests updated to use 3007
**Recommendation:** Configure consistent port

### Issue 3: EPERM Error During Prisma Generate
**Observed:** File lock error when dev server is running
**Impact:** None - database migration successful
**Workaround:** Ignore the error, migration completed
