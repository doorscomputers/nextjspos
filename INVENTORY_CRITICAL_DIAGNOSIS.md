# üö® CRITICAL INVENTORY INTEGRITY ISSUE - DIAGNOSIS REPORT

**Date:** October 25, 2025
**Product:** ADATA 512GB 2.5 SSD (SKU: 4711085931528, Product ID: 343)
**Location:** Main Store (Location ID: 1)
**Reported By:** Business Owner
**Severity:** CRITICAL - BLOCKS PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT

---

## Executive Summary

The inventory management system has a critical data integrity issue where:
- **Stock History Report calculates: 20 units**
- **Actual system inventory shows: 4 units**
- **Discrepancy: 16 units (400% error)**

This means customers could purchase products that don't actually exist in inventory, causing fulfillment failures, customer dissatisfaction, and financial losses.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### What Happened (Timeline):

1. **Oct 20, 2025** - CSV Import set opening stock to **22 units**
   - ‚úÖ `productHistory` created: 22 units opening stock
   - ‚úÖ `variationLocationDetails.qtyAvailable` set to 22 units
   - Status: **CORRECT**

2. **Oct 22, 2025** - Transfer IN: +2 units
   - ‚úÖ Stock transaction recorded in `stockTransaction`
   - ‚úÖ `productHistory` created
   - ‚ùå **BUT: `qtyAvailable` NOT updated!**
   - Expected: 24 units | Actual: Still ~22 units

3. **Oct 23, 2025** - Transfer OUT: -1 unit
   - ‚úÖ Stock transaction recorded
   - ‚úÖ `productHistory` created
   - ‚ùå **BUT: `qtyAvailable` NOT updated!**

4. **Oct 23, 2025** - Sale: -2 units
   - ‚úÖ Stock transaction recorded
   - ‚úÖ `productHistory` created
   - ‚ùå **BUT: `qtyAvailable` NOT updated!**

5. **Oct 24, 2025** - Inventory Adjustment: -1 unit
   - ‚úÖ Stock transaction recorded
   - ‚úÖ `productHistory` created
   - ‚ùå **BUT: `qtyAvailable` NOT updated!**

### Current State:

**Stock Transactions (Main Store only):**
```
Transfer IN:   +2
Transfer OUT:  -1
Sale:          -2
Adjustment:    -1
---------------
Net Change:    -2 units
```

**Expected Final Balance:** 22 (opening) + (-2) = **20 units**
**Actual `qtyAvailable`:** **4 units**
**Missing:** **16 units**

---

## The Critical Bug

**STOCK TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT UPDATING `variationLocationDetails.qtyAvailable`!**

When transactions occur (sales, transfers, adjustments):
- ‚úÖ Transaction recorded in `stockTransaction` table
- ‚úÖ History logged in `productHistory` table
- ‚ùå **INVENTORY NOT UPDATED** in `variationLocationDetails.qtyAvailable`

This breaks the fundamental integrity of the system:
- Reports calculate from transaction history (shows 20)
- Inventory checks use `qtyAvailable` (shows 4)
- **They don't match!**

---

## Impact Assessment

### Business Impact:
- ‚ùå **Cannot trust inventory numbers**
- ‚ùå **Cannot fulfill orders accurately**
- ‚ùå **Risk of overselling products**
- ‚ùå **Risk of stockouts without warning**
- ‚ùå **Financial reporting inaccurate**
- ‚ùå **Reorder points unreliable**

### Technical Debt:
- All inventory transactions since Oct 22 are potentially corrupted
- Unknown how many other products are affected
- Data integrity cannot be guaranteed

### Deployment Blockers:
- **CANNOT deploy to production** with this bug
- Requires immediate investigation and fix
- May need data correction for all affected products

---

## Investigation Findings

### Database Evidence:

**`variationLocationDetails` (Actual Inventory):**
```sql
qtyAvailable: 4 units
openingStockLocked: false
openingStockSetAt: null
```

**`productHistory` (Transaction Log):**
```
1. [2025-10-20] opening_stock: +22 units (CSV-IMPORT-343)
2. [2025-10-23] transfer_out:  -1 unit
3. [2025-10-23] sale:          -2 units
4. [2025-10-24] adjustment:    -1 unit
```

**Missing from `productHistory`:**
- ‚ùå No "Transfer IN +2" record for Main Store!
- This transfer went to Main Store but history doesn't show it

**`stockTransaction` (All Transactions):**
```
Found 12 total transactions (all locations)
Main Store specific:
- Transfer IN:   +2 units
- Transfer OUT:  -1 unit
- Sale:          -2 units
- Adjustment:    -1 unit
```

## Questions That Need Answers:

1. **Which API endpoints/functions are responsible for updating `qtyAvailable`?**
   - Sales API
   - Transfer API
   - Adjustment API
   - Purchase Receipt API

2. **Are these endpoints actually calling the inventory update logic?**
   - Need to audit all transaction processing code

3. **Is there a missing service/function call?**
   - Should there be a centralized inventory update service?

4. **Was this working before and broke recently?**
   - Or has it never worked?

5. **How many products are affected?**
   - Need to run system-wide audit

---

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Before any deployment):

1. **AUDIT ALL TRANSACTION PROCESSING CODE**
   - Review: `/api/sales`, `/api/transfers`, `/api/adjustments`, `/api/purchases`
   - Verify each one updates `variationLocationDetails.qtyAvailable`

2. **CREATE INVENTORY SYNC UTILITY**
   - Rebuild all `qtyAvailable` from transaction history
   - Compare with current values
   - Generate discrepancy report

3. **FIX THE BUG**
   - Ensure ALL transaction types update inventory
   - Add database triggers as backup?
   - Add validation checks

4. **DATA CORRECTION SCRIPT**
   - Recalculate correct inventory for all products
   - Update `qtyAvailable` to match transaction history
   - Log all corrections for audit trail

### Short Term:

1. **Add Automated Tests**
   - Test that sales reduce inventory
   - Test that purchases increase inventory
   - Test that transfers move inventory correctly
   - Test that adjustments update correctly

2. **Add Real-time Validation**
   - After every transaction, verify inventory updated
   - Alert if mismatch detected
   - Prevent transaction completion if update fails

3. **Add Reconciliation Report**
   - Daily automated check: transaction sum vs `qtyAvailable`
   - Flag discrepancies immediately
   - Email alerts to admin

### Long Term:

1. **Database Constraints**
   - Add triggers to maintain consistency
   - Add CHECK constraints where possible

2. **Audit Trail Enhancement**
   - Log every `qtyAvailable` change with before/after values
   - Track which API/function made the change

3. **Monitoring Dashboard**
   - Real-time inventory integrity health check
   - Alert on any discrepancies

## Files Requiring Investigation:

1. `/src/app/api/sales/route.ts` - Sales transaction processing
2. `/src/app/api/transfers/route.ts` - Stock transfer processing
3. `/src/app/api/adjustments/route.ts` - Inventory adjustment processing
4. `/src/app/api/purchases/receipts/route.ts` - Purchase receipt processing
5. `/src/lib/inventory.ts` - Core inventory update logic (if exists)
6. `/src/lib/stock-transaction.ts` - Transaction creation logic

---

## Next Steps:

**STOP ALL WORK ON DEPLOYMENT**

**Priority 1: Find the inventory update code (or lack thereof)**
**Priority 2: Fix all transaction processors to update inventory**
**Priority 3: Create data correction script**
**Priority 4: Run system-wide inventory audit**
**Priority 5: Add automated tests and monitoring**

---

## Conclusion:

This is not a small bug - this is a **fundamental system integrity failure**. The inventory management system is recording transactions but not updating actual inventory levels. This makes the entire system unreliable for production use.

**DO NOT DEPLOY until this is resolved.**

The business owner's concern is 100% justified. The system appeared to be working correctly on the surface (Stock History report shows correct calculations), but underneath, the actual inventory database is completely out of sync.

**Estimated Fix Time:** 2-4 hours to identify all issues + 2-4 hours to fix + 4-8 hours to test and correct data = **1-2 days minimum**

**Risk Level if deployed as-is:** CATASTROPHIC
