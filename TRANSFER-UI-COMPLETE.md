### **RECOMMENDED NEXT: Customer Returns/Refunds System**

Since you asked about refunds and warranty returns, the **next priority** should be:

**Customer Returns System** (see main conversation for details)
- Create return from original sale
- Handle warranty claims
- Process refunds/replacements
- Track damaged/defective items
- Stock restoration for resellable items

This is **critical** for handling customer complaints, warranty issues, and refunds!

## 📝 Notes

- **Stock accuracy is CRITICAL** - All stock movements are logged in `StockTransaction` table
- **Completed transfers are IMMUTABLE** - Cannot be modified or cancelled after completion
- **Serial numbers are tracked** (if enabled) through entire transfer process
- **Audit logs** record every action for compliance and tracking
- **Multi-tenant isolation** enforced - users only see transfers for their business
