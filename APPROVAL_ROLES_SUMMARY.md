## Existing Approval Permissions in System

The following approval-related permissions already exist in UltimatePOS:

| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `inventory_correction.approve` | Approve inventory corrections |
| `cash.approve_large_transactions` | Approve large cash transactions |
| `void.approve` | Approve void transactions |
| `purchase.approve` | Approve purchase orders |
| `purchase.receipt.approve` | Approve GRNs (purchase receipts) |
| `purchase_return.approve` | Approve purchase returns |
| `purchase_amendment.approve` | Approve purchase amendments |
| `qc_inspection.view` | View QC inspections |
| `qc_inspection.create` | Create QC inspections |
| `qc_inspection.conduct` | Conduct QC inspections |
| `qc_inspection.approve` | Approve QC inspections |
| `payment.approve` | Approve payments |
| `customer_return.approve` | Approve customer returns |
| `supplier_return.approve` | Approve supplier returns |
| `freebie.approve` | Approve freebies/free items |

**Note:** Transfer approvals use a different permission pattern (`stock_transfer.send`, `stock_transfer.receive`, etc.) since transfers are a multi-step process.

---

## Permission Philosophy

### What Approval Roles CAN Do

✅ **View** related data (products, suppliers, customers, locations)
✅ **Approve** or **Reject** specific transactions
✅ **Verify** data accuracy before approval
✅ **View reports** related to their approval domain
✅ **View audit logs** for accountability

### What Approval Roles CANNOT Do

❌ **Create** new products, suppliers, customers, etc.
❌ **Edit** master data (pricing, product details, etc.)
❌ **Delete** any records
❌ **Process refunds** (requires separate payment permission)
❌ **Modify** system settings
❌ **Access** financial/profitability reports (unless explicitly granted)

---

## Multi-Tenant & Location Isolation

### Business Isolation
- All roles are scoped to a specific `businessId`
- Users can only be assigned roles from their own business
- Permission checks always filter by `businessId` from session

### Location-Based Access Control

**Option 1: User-Level Location Assignment**
```javascript
// Allow user to access specific locations
await prisma.userLocation.createMany({
  data: [
    { userId: 123, locationId: 1 }, // Main Warehouse
    { userId: 123, locationId: 2 }  // Retail Branch A
  ]
})
```

**Option 2: Role-Level Location Restriction**
```javascript
// Restrict role to specific locations
await prisma.roleLocation.create({
  data: {
    roleId: 456, // Transfer Approver
    locationId: 1 // Main Warehouse only
  }
})
```

**Option 3: Grant All Location Access**
```javascript
// Grant access to all locations
const permission = await prisma.permission.findUnique({
  where: { name: 'access_all_locations' }
})

await prisma.rolePermission.create({
  data: {
    roleId: 456,
    permissionId: permission.id
  }
})
```

---

## Installation & Usage

### Step 1: Create Approval Roles

```bash
# Run the creation script
node scripts/create-approval-roles.mjs

# Or use SQL script
# Edit scripts/create-approval-roles.sql first
# Then execute in your database
```

### Step 2: Verify Roles Were Created

```bash
# Open Prisma Studio
npx prisma studio

# Navigate to 'roles' table
# Look for the 6 new approval roles
```

### Step 3: Assign Roles to Users

**Option A: Interactive Script (Recommended)**
```bash
node scripts/assign-approval-role.mjs
```

**Option B: Prisma Studio**
1. Open Prisma Studio
2. Go to `user_roles` table
3. Add new record with `userId` and `roleId`

**Option C: Programmatically**
```javascript
await prisma.userRole.create({
  data: {
    userId: 123,
    roleId: 456
  }
})
```

### Step 4: Test Approval Workflow

1. Login as the user with approval role
2. Navigate to the relevant section (e.g., Transfers, GRNs)
3. Verify approval options are visible
4. Test approve/reject functionality
5. Check audit logs

---

## Multi-Role Assignment Examples

### Example 1: Cashier + Return Approver
**Scenario:** POS staff who can also approve returns on the spot

```javascript
await prisma.userRole.createMany({
  data: [
    { userId: 123, roleId: cashierRoleId },
    { userId: 123, roleId: returnApproverRoleId }
  ]
})
```

**Result:** User can process sales AND approve customer returns

---

### Example 2: Branch Manager + All Approvers
**Scenario:** Branch manager who oversees all approval processes

```javascript
await prisma.userRole.createMany({
  data: [
    { userId: 456, roleId: branchManagerRoleId },
    { userId: 456, roleId: transferApproverRoleId },
    { userId: 456, roleId: grnApproverRoleId },
    { userId: 456, roleId: inventoryCorrectionApproverRoleId },
    { userId: 456, roleId: returnApproverRoleId }
  ]
})
```

**Result:** User has full branch management + all approval capabilities

---

### Example 3: QC Inspector + GRN Approver
**Scenario:** Quality control staff who also approves receipts after inspection

```javascript
await prisma.userRole.createMany({
  data: [
    { userId: 789, roleId: qcInspectorRoleId },
    { userId: 789, roleId: grnApproverRoleId }
  ]
})
```

**Result:** Streamlined QC → GRN approval workflow (same person)

---

## Security & Best Practices

### Separation of Duties

✅ **DO:** Separate requestor and approver roles
```
User A creates transfer request
User B (Transfer Approver) approves it
```

❌ **DON'T:** Assign both creator and approver to same user for same location
```
User A creates AND approves their own transfer request (security risk!)
```

### Audit Logging

**Always log approval actions:**

```javascript
await prisma.auditLog.create({
  data: {
    userId: session.user.id,
    businessId: session.user.businessId,
    action: 'APPROVE_TRANSFER',
    entity: 'Transfer',
    entityId: transferId,
    description: `Approved transfer #${transferId} from ${fromLocation} to ${toLocation}`,
    ipAddress: req.headers['x-forwarded-for'],
    userAgent: req.headers['user-agent']
  }
})
```

### Regular Reviews

- **Monthly:** Review approval activities in audit logs
- **Quarterly:** Review user role assignments
- **Annually:** Review and update approval workflows

### Least Privilege Principle

Only assign the minimum permissions needed. For example:
- If user only approves transfers at one location → assign only that location
- If user only approves transfers (not GRNs) → don't assign GRN Approver role

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: User can't see approval options in UI

**Possible Causes:**
1. Role not assigned in `user_roles` table
2. Permissions not assigned in `role_permissions` table
3. Session not refreshed after role assignment
4. UI component checking wrong permission

**Solutions:**
```javascript
// 1. Verify role assignment
const userRoles = await prisma.userRole.findMany({
  where: { userId: 123 },
  include: { role: true }
})
console.log('User roles:', userRoles)

// 2. Ask user to logout and login again

// 3. Check UI component permission check
import { hasPermission } from '@/lib/rbac'
const canApprove = hasPermission(user, 'stock_transfer.send')
```

---

### Issue: Permission denied errors in API

**Possible Causes:**
1. Permission constant name mismatch
2. Session doesn't include updated permissions
3. API route checking wrong permission

**Solutions:**
```javascript
// 1. Verify permission name matches exactly
import { PERMISSIONS } from '@/lib/rbac'
console.log('Permission constant:', PERMISSIONS.STOCK_TRANSFER_SEND)
// Should match database: 'stock_transfer.send'

// 2. Check session permissions
const session = await getServerSession(authOptions)
console.log('Session permissions:', session.user.permissions)

// 3. Use correct permission check
if (!hasPermission(session.user, PERMISSIONS.STOCK_TRANSFER_SEND)) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Forbidden' }, { status: 403 })
}
```

---

### Issue: User sees all locations instead of assigned ones

**Possible Causes:**
1. User has `access_all_locations` permission
2. No locations assigned in `user_locations` table
3. Location filtering not implemented in query

**Solutions:**
```javascript
// 1. Check if user has all-location access
const hasAllAccess = hasPermission(user, PERMISSIONS.ACCESS_ALL_LOCATIONS)
console.log('Has all location access:', hasAllAccess)

// 2. Assign specific locations
await prisma.userLocation.create({
  data: { userId: 123, locationId: 1 }
})

// 3. Use location filter in queries
import { getLocationWhereClause } from '@/lib/rbac'
const locationFilter = getLocationWhereClause(session.user, 'locationId')

const transfers = await prisma.transfer.findMany({
  where: {
    businessId: session.user.businessId,
    ...locationFilter
  }
})
```

---

## Advanced Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Approval Limits Based on Transaction Value

**Requirement:**
- Transfer Approver can approve up to $10,000
- Manager can approve up to $50,000
- Admin required for $50,000+

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Add approvalLimit to role assignment
// (Requires schema modification)
const transfer = await prisma.transfer.findUnique({ where: { id: transferId } })
const userRole = await prisma.userRole.findFirst({
  where: { userId: session.user.id, roleId: transferApproverRoleId }
})

if (transfer.totalValue > userRole.approvalLimit) {
  return NextResponse.json({
    error: 'Transfer value exceeds your approval limit. Manager approval required.'
  }, { status: 403 })
}
```

---

### Scenario 2: Time-Based Approval Windows

**Requirement:**
- Weekend transfers require manager approval
- Weekday transfers can be auto-approved if under $5,000

**Implementation:**
```javascript
const isWeekend = [0, 6].includes(new Date().getDay())
const requiresManagerApproval = isWeekend || transfer.totalValue > 5000

if (requiresManagerApproval && !hasRole(user, 'Branch Manager')) {
  return NextResponse.json({
    error: 'This transfer requires manager approval.'
  }, { status: 403 })
}
```

---

### Scenario 3: Multi-Level Approval Workflow

**Requirement:**
- Level 1: Transfer Approver (max $10k)
- Level 2: Branch Manager (max $50k)
- Level 3: Regional Manager (unlimited)

**Implementation:**
```javascript
const approvalLevels = {
  'Transfer Approver': 10000,
  'Branch Manager': 50000,
  'Regional Manager': Infinity
}

const userMaxApproval = Math.max(
  ...user.roles.map(role => approvalLevels[role] || 0)
)

if (transfer.totalValue > userMaxApproval) {
  return NextResponse.json({
    error: `Requires approval from user with limit >= $${transfer.totalValue}`
  }, { status: 403 })
}
```
