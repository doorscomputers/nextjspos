## 💡 **Pro Tips**

### Tip 1: Best Way to See Changes
Open **Theme Demo (Simple)** in one browser tab, then:
1. Click a theme
2. Instantly see the 3 color boxes change
3. See buttons/cards update
4. Very satisfying! 😊

### Tip 2: Compare Themes
1. Open demo page
2. Click through each theme slowly
3. Notice the different color schemes
4. Pick your favorite!

### Tip 3: Use in Your Components
Once you've picked a theme, use `tf-*` classes in your components:

```tsx
<button className="tf-btn tf-btn-primary">
  My Button
</button>
```

This button will automatically use the current theme's primary color!

## 📊 **Expected Behavior**

### ✅ What SHOULD Happen:
1. Click "Sunset Boulevard"
2. Color swatches change to orange/peach/golden
3. Buttons become coral colored
4. Cards borders become peachy
5. ALL instantly updated

### ❌ What WON'T Happen (Yet):
- Your existing dashboard pages won't change
- Products page won't change
- Sales page won't change
- **Why?** They're using regular Tailwind/ShadCN classes, not `tf-*` classes

### 🔧 To Make Existing Pages Use Themes:
Add `tf-*` classes to your components:
```tsx
// Before:
<button className="bg-blue-500 text-white">Click</button>

// After (theme-aware):
<button className="tf-btn tf-btn-primary">Click</button>
```
