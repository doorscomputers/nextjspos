# POS Improvements - January 13, 2025 (Session 3)

## ✅ All Tasks Completed

This document summarizes the four improvements requested and implemented in this session.

---

## 1. Cash In/Out: Numeric-Only with Auto-Open Keypad ✅

### Problem
Cash In and Cash Out dialogs accepted text input and didn't automatically open the numeric keypad like the Amount Tendered field does.

### Solution
Modified both Cash In and Cash Out dialogs to:
- Use numeric keypad automatically when clicking the amount input
- Made input readonly to prevent manual text entry
- Only allow numeric input through the keypad

### Files Changed
- `src/app/dashboard/pos-v2/page.tsx`
  - Line 94: Updated keypadTarget type to include 'cashin' and 'cashout'
  - Line 657-664: Updated `openKeypad` function to handle new targets
  - Line 680-692: Updated `confirmKeypadValue` function to set Cash In/Out amounts
  - Line 2190-2198: Modified Cash In dialog input to use keypad
  - Line 2230-2238: Modified Cash Out dialog input to use keypad

### Testing
1. Open POS V2 page
2. Click "Cash In" button
3. Click the amount field → numeric keypad should open automatically
4. Enter amount using keypad → amount appears in field
5. Click OK on keypad → amount is set
6. Repeat for "Cash Out" button

## 2. Unique Customer Names ✅

### Problem
Multiple customers could have the same name within a business, causing confusion.

### Solution
Added a partial unique index on the database that enforces unique customer names within each business (excluding soft-deleted records).

### Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Fix Existing Duplicates
Created scripts to identify and clean up duplicates:
- `check-duplicate-customers.js` - Identifies duplicate customer names
- `fix-duplicate-customers.js` - Soft deletes duplicates, preserving the oldest record and moving any transactions to it

Found and resolved:
- Business 1: "Juan de la Cruz" (2 records) → Kept ID 1 (with 1 sale), soft-deleted ID 2

#### Step 2: Add Partial Unique Index
Created `apply-customer-constraint.js` to add:
```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX customers_business_id_name_unique
ON customers (business_id, name)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
```

This allows the same name only if one is soft-deleted, supporting the "undelete" pattern.

### Files Changed
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - No change needed (constraint handled at database level)
- `check-duplicate-customers.js` - New diagnostic script
- `fix-duplicate-customers.js` - New cleanup script
- `apply-customer-constraint.js` - New constraint application script
- `add-customer-unique-constraint.sql` - SQL documentation

### Verification
Run `node check-duplicate-customers.js` to confirm no duplicates exist.

## 3. Validate Unique Customer Name in Quick Add ✅

### Problem
When adding a customer via the Quick Add dialog in POS, there was no validation to prevent duplicate names.

### Solution
Added dual-layer validation:

#### Frontend Validation (POS Page)
- Checks if customer name exists in the loaded customers array (case-insensitive)
- Shows error message before API call
- Fast feedback for users

#### Backend Validation (API)
- Checks database for existing customer name (case-insensitive)
- Returns 409 Conflict status if duplicate found
- Ensures data integrity even if frontend is bypassed

### Files Changed
- `src/app/dashboard/pos-v2/page.tsx` (Lines 1076-1084)
  ```typescript
  // Check if customer name already exists (case-insensitive)
  const existingCustomer = customers.find(c =>
    c.name.toLowerCase().trim() === newCustomerName.toLowerCase().trim()
  )

  if (existingCustomer) {
    setError(`Customer name "${newCustomerName}" already exists. Please use a different name.`)
    return
  }
  ```

- `src/app/api/customers/route.ts` (Lines 102-119)
  ```typescript
  // Check if customer name already exists for this business (case-insensitive)
  const existingCustomer = await prisma.customer.findFirst({
    where: {
      businessId: parseInt(businessId),
      name: {
        equals: name.trim(),
        mode: 'insensitive'
      },
      deletedAt: null
    }
  })

  if (existingCustomer) {
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: `Customer name "${name}" already exists. Please use a different name.` },
      { status: 409 }
    )
  }
  ```

### Testing
1. Open POS V2
2. Click "+ New" customer button
3. Try to enter a customer name that already exists (e.g., "Juan de la Cruz")
4. System should show error: "Customer name already exists. Please use a different name."
5. Enter a unique name → customer should be created successfully

## 4. Create Customer CRUD Page ✅

### Problem
The "Customers" menu item navigated to `/dashboard/customers` which returned a 404 error because the page didn't exist.

### Solution
Created a complete Customer CRUD page with:
- List view with search functionality
- Add customer dialog
- Edit customer functionality
- Delete customer functionality (soft delete)
- Permission-based access control
- Responsive design matching the POS system

### New Files Created

#### 1. Customer Page
`src/app/dashboard/customers/page.tsx`
- Full CRUD interface
- Search by name, email, or mobile
- Add/Edit dialog with validation
- Delete with confirmation
- Uses Shadcn UI components
- Permission checks for all actions

#### 2. Customer API Routes
`src/app/api/customers/[id]/route.ts`
- **PUT**: Update customer
  - Validates name uniqueness (excluding current customer)
  - Checks permissions
  - Handles case-insensitive name conflicts
- **DELETE**: Soft delete customer
  - Checks permissions
  - Soft deletes (sets deletedAt)
  - Preserves customer history

### Features
- **Search**: Real-time filtering by name, email, or mobile
- **Add**: Modal dialog with fields:
  - Name* (required)
  - Email (optional)
  - Mobile (optional)
  - Address (optional)
- **Edit**: Click pencil icon to edit customer details
- **Delete**: Click trash icon to soft delete (with confirmation)
- **Status Badge**: Shows Active/Inactive status
- **Permissions**:
  - View requires `CUSTOMER_VIEW`
  - Create requires `CUSTOMER_CREATE`
  - Update requires `CUSTOMER_UPDATE`
  - Delete requires `CUSTOMER_DELETE`

### Design
- Matches modern gradient design of Products page
- Responsive layout
- Loading states
- Empty states with helpful messages
- Toast notifications for all actions

### Testing
1. Navigate to Dashboard → Customers menu
2. Page should load without 404 error
3. Test search functionality
4. Test adding a new customer
5. Test editing an existing customer
6. Test deleting a customer (confirm soft delete)
7. Verify duplicate name validation works

## Notes

1. **Soft Delete Pattern**: Customers are soft-deleted (deletedAt timestamp) to preserve transaction history
2. **Case-Insensitive**: All name comparisons are case-insensitive
3. **Multi-Tenant**: Unique constraint is per business, not global
4. **Permissions**: All operations respect RBAC permissions
5. **Audit Trail**: Customer history is preserved even after deletion
