# Inventory Discrepancy Resolution Summary

**Issue Reported:** ADATA 512GB 2.5 SSD shows -1.00 unit discrepancy at Main Warehouse

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Stock is actually correct, report calculation issue identified

---

## Quick Summary

### The Good News
Your actual inventory is **CORRECT**. You have exactly **21 units** of ADATA 512GB 2.5 SSD at Main Warehouse.

### The Problem
The stock history report shows a discrepancy because:
1. Opening stock (11 units) exists in `ProductHistory` table but is missing from `StockTransaction` table
2. The report calculation includes opening stock but doesn't account for the missing transaction
3. This creates a "phantom" discrepancy of -1 unit when calculating expected vs actual

### What Happened
```
ProductHistory (Complete):
  Opening Stock:    +11.00
  Purchase 1:       +1.00
  Purchase 2:       +10.00
  Supplier Return:  -1.00
  Total:            21.00 ✅

StockTransaction (Missing opening_stock):
  [Missing: Opening Stock +11.00]  ← THIS IS THE PROBLEM!
  Purchase 1:       +1.00  (balance shows 12.00 because it includes the missing opening stock)
  Purchase 2:       +10.00 (balance shows 22.00)
  Supplier Return:  -1.00  (balance shows 21.00)

  If you calculate from transactions only: 1 + 10 - 1 = 10.00 ❌
  But balances show 21.00 ✅ (because they include the invisible opening stock)

## Recommended Actions

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Insert Missing Opening Stock)

**Pros:**
- Simple SQL insert
- Makes StockTransaction complete
- Fixes the report immediately

**Cons:**
- Need to recalculate all subsequent transaction balances
- Requires database backup before running

**How to do it:**

```bash
# Step 1: Backup database
pg_dump -U postgres -d ultimatepos_modern > backup_before_fix.sql

# Step 2: Run the fix script
node fix-missing-opening-stock.mjs

# Step 3: Verify the fix
node forensic-inventory-analysis.mjs
```

### Option 2: Report-Only Fix (Recommended)

**Pros:**
- No database changes needed
- Lower risk
- Faster to implement

**Cons:**
- Doesn't fix the underlying data inconsistency
- Future reports may have same issue

**How to do it:**

Update the stock history report to use `ProductHistory` exclusively. The report already queries ProductHistory correctly (line 211-227 in `src/lib/stock-history.ts`), so the issue is likely in how the summary calculates "Total Transactions Recorded."

### Option 3: Standardize on ProductHistory (Long-Term)

**Pros:**
- ProductHistory is more complete
- Single source of truth
- Prevents future inconsistencies

**Cons:**
- Requires code refactoring
- Need to update all code that writes to StockTransaction

## System-Wide Impact

This issue likely affects **all products** that have opening stock imported via CSV.

To check how many products are affected:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ph.product_variation_id) as affected_products
FROM product_history ph
LEFT JOIN stock_transactions st
  ON st.product_variation_id = ph.product_variation_id
  AND st.location_id = ph.location_id
  AND st.type = 'opening_stock'
WHERE ph.transaction_type = 'opening_stock'
  AND st.id IS NULL;
```

## For the User: What You Should Do

### Immediate Action: **NONE REQUIRED**
Your stock levels are accurate. This is a cosmetic issue in reporting only.

### If You Want to Fix the Report:

**Option A (Easy):** Ignore the "expected vs actual" calculation in the report. Use the "Current Stock" as the truth.

**Option B (Proper Fix):** Run the `fix-missing-opening-stock.mjs` script to add missing opening stock transactions. This will make the report show correctly.

### Before Running Any Fix Script:
1. **Backup your database** (critical!)
2. Test on a staging environment first (if available)
3. Run during off-hours when no one is using the system
4. Verify the fix with `forensic-inventory-analysis.mjs` afterward

## Technical Details

### Why This Happened

When opening stock was imported (likely from CSV), the import process:
1. ✅ Created `ProductHistory` records with type `opening_stock`
2. ✅ Updated `VariationLocationDetails` with opening quantities
3. ❌ **Did NOT create** `StockTransaction` records with type `opening_stock`

Later, when purchases were made:
1. ✅ Created `StockTransaction` records
2. ✅ Created `ProductHistory` records
3. ✅ But calculated `balanceQty` by reading from `VariationLocationDetails` (which includes opening stock)

This created a situation where:
- `StockTransaction.balanceQty` includes opening stock in the value
- But there's no `opening_stock` transaction in `StockTransaction` table
- Manual recalculation from transactions gives wrong result

### The Database Schema Issue

The system uses **dual transaction tracking**:
- `stock_transactions` - For transaction history
- `product_history` - For audit trail and reporting

These tables should mirror each other, but they don't. Different code paths write to different tables.

**Solution:** Either:
1. Always write to both tables (dual-write pattern)
2. OR: Use one table as source of truth (recommend ProductHistory)

## Verification After Fix

After applying any fix, verify with these checks:

### Check 1: Transaction Count
```sql
SELECT
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM stock_transactions
   WHERE product_variation_id = 343 AND location_id = 2) as st_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM product_history
   WHERE product_variation_id = 343 AND location_id = 2) as ph_count;
```
Should be equal after fix.

### Check 2: Balance Match
```sql
SELECT
  vld.qty_available,
  st.balance_qty as st_balance,
  ph.balance_quantity as ph_balance
FROM variation_location_details vld
LEFT JOIN LATERAL (
  SELECT balance_qty FROM stock_transactions
  WHERE product_variation_id = 343 AND location_id = 2
  ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1
) st ON true
LEFT JOIN LATERAL (
  SELECT balance_quantity FROM product_history
  WHERE product_variation_id = 343 AND location_id = 2
  ORDER BY transaction_date DESC LIMIT 1
) ph ON true
WHERE vld.product_variation_id = 343 AND vld.location_id = 2;
```
All three values should match.

### Check 3: Manual Calculation
```bash
node deep-dive-discrepancy.mjs
```
Look for "MISMATCH" warnings - there should be none after fix.

A: No, your stock count of 21 units is correct.

**Q: Did I lose 1 unit?**
A: No, you didn't lose anything. This is a report calculation issue.

**Q: Should I do a physical count?**
A: Not necessary for this specific issue, but regular physical counts are always good practice.

**Q: Will this affect other products?**
A: Yes, any product with opening stock imported via CSV likely has the same issue.

**Q: Is this a security issue?**
A: No, this is a data consistency issue in reporting, not a security vulnerability.

**Q: Can I safely ignore this?**
A: Yes, if you trust the "Current Stock" field. The actual inventory levels are accurate.
