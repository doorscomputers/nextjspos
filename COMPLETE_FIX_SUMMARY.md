- Each location now has independent invoice numbering

**Files Modified:**
- `scripts/fix-constraints.ts` (created)

**Issue:** 9 products had mismatched physical vs ledger stock
**Fix:**
- Created diagnostic script
- Scanned 6,152 variations
- Fixed 9 discrepancies (42 units total variance)
- Synced physical stock to match ledger

**Files Modified:**
- `scripts/fix-stock-discrepancies.ts` (created)
- `scripts/diagnose-shift.ts` (created)

**Verification:** ‚úÖ 0 discrepancies after fix

---

## 2. ‚úÖ TYPESCRIPT / COMPILATION FIXES

### 2.1 Missing RBAC Permissions
**Issue:** TypeScript errors for undefined permissions
**Fix:** Added missing permissions:
- `TRANSFER_APPROVE`
- `TRANSFER_MANAGE`
- `SUPPLIER_RETURN_MANAGE`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/rbac.ts` (lines 254-255, 267)

---

### 2.2 Stock History Types
**Issue:** Missing transaction types causing TypeScript errors
**Fix:** Added:
- `supplier_return`
- `correction`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/stock-history.ts` (lines 23-24)

---

### 2.3 Component Fixes
**Issues Fixed:**
- ProductAutocomplete: useRef type error
- serialNumber.ts: Duplicate property
- apiClient.ts: Idempotency-Key header type

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/ProductAutocomplete.tsx` (line 46)

- `src/lib/client/apiClient.ts` (line 137)

---

## 3. ‚úÖ RUNTIME ERROR FIXES

### 3.1 X Reading Address Field Error
**Issue:** Tried to access non-existent `address` field on BusinessLocation
**Fix:**
- Changed to use correct fields: `landmark`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `zipCode`
- Constructed address string from components

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/api/readings/x-reading/route.ts` (lines 59-77, 92-110)

**Verification:** ‚úÖ X Reading generates without errors

---

### 3.2 Stock Validation Discrepancies
**Issue:** Existing data had mismatches
**Fix:** Ran sync script to align physical with ledger

**Files Modified:**
- Fixed via `fix-stock-discrepancies.ts`

---

## 4. ‚úÖ SHIFT CLOSE VARIANCE FIX (Critical)

### Issue Identified
**Problem:** Variance calculation was counting full payment amounts when customers overpaid and received change.

**Example of Bug:**
```
Sale Total:      ‚Ç±430
Customer Paid:   ‚Ç±500 (cash)
Change Given:    ‚Ç±70

‚ùå OLD: Counted ‚Ç±500 in drawer
‚úÖ NEW: Counts ‚Ç±430 in drawer (correct)
```

### Root Cause
From diagnostic on actual shift:
- Sale #1: ‚Ç±430 total, paid ‚Ç±500 ‚Üí ‚Ç±70 change (overcounted)
- Sale #2: ‚Ç±590 total, paid ‚Ç±600 ‚Üí ‚Ç±10 change (overcounted)
- **Total overage: ‚Ç±80 being incorrectly counted**

This explained the user's reported ‚Ç±30 variance issue.

### Solution Implemented
Added proportional allocation logic:
```typescript
if (totalPayments > saleTotal) {
  const allocationRatio = saleTotal / totalPayments
  actualCashInDrawer = cashPayments * allocationRatio
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/api/shifts/[id]/close/route.ts` (lines 122-147)

### User's Specific Case
```
Beginning Cash:  ‚Ç±5,000
Sale 1 cash:     ‚Ç±3,900 (after ‚Ç±60 digital)
Sale 2 cash:     ‚Ç±480
                ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
Expected:        ‚Ç±9,380
Actual counted:  ‚Ç±9,370
                ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
Variance:        -‚Ç±10 (SHORT) ‚úÖ CORRECT!
```

**Previously:** System showed ‚Ç±30 short (WRONG)
**Now:** System shows ‚Ç±10 short (CORRECT)

## 5. ‚úÖ READINGS HISTORY PAGE (New Feature)

### Overview
Created comprehensive page to view and print ALL past X and Z readings.

### Features Implemented
1. **List View** - All historical readings in clean cards
2. **Advanced Filters:**
   - Reading type (All / X Reading / Z Reading)
   - Search by shift #, cashier, location
   - Date range filter (from/to)
3. **Quick Actions:**
   - View full reading details
   - Print any historical reading
4. **Smart Defaults:**
   - Newest readings first
   - Shows result counts
   - Responsive design

### Files Created
- `src/app/dashboard/readings/history/page.tsx` (new)
- `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` (updated - added menu items)

### Navigation Added
- X Reading (menu item)
- Z Reading (menu item)
- **Readings History** (new menu item)

### Z Reading Auto-Load Fix
**Issue:** Z Reading page required shift ID, showed error if accessed directly
**Fix:**
- Automatically loads most recent closed shift if no ID provided
- Helpful error with link to Readings History
- Fallback guidance for users

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/dashboard/readings/z-reading/page.tsx` (lines 9-64, 81-102)
