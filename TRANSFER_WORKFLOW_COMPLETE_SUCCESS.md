## 🐛 Issues Fixed During Testing

### 1. Auto-Assignment Not Displaying
- **Problem:** "From Location" field showed placeholder instead of auto-assigned location
- **Fix:** Updated `src/app/dashboard/transfers/create/page.tsx` to properly set and display location
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

### 2. Permission Naming Mismatch
- **Problem:** Created permissions with underscores (`stock_transfer_view`) instead of dots
- **Fix:** Script `scripts/fix-transfer-roles.mjs` corrected all permissions to `stock_transfer.view` format
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

### 3. Inventory Ledger Discrepancy
- **Problem:** Ledger showed variance because it only queried `completed` transfers, not `in_transit`
- **Fix:** Updated `src/app/api/reports/inventory-ledger/route.ts` to include in_transit transfers and use sentAt date
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

### 4. Missing Receiver Permissions
- **Problem:** Transfer Receiver role missing `stock_transfer.verify` and `stock_transfer.complete` permissions
- **Fix:** Script `scripts/update-receiver-role.mjs` added missing permissions
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

### 5. No Quick Receive Option
- **Problem:** Users forced through multi-step verification (arrived → verifying → complete)
- **Fix:** Added "Receive Transfer" quick button in `src/app/dashboard/transfers/[id]/page.tsx`
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

### 6. Prisma Schema Errors (3 issues)
- **Problem 1:** Including non-existent `serialNumbers` relation on StockTransferItem
- **Fix:** Removed incorrect includes, use JSON fields instead
- **Problem 2:** Using non-existent field `receiveNotes`
- **Fix:** Changed to `verifierNotes` (correct field name)
- **Problem 3:** Using `quantityReceived` instead of `receivedQuantity`
- **Fix:** Corrected field name in update statement
- **Status:** ✅ All Fixed in `src/app/api/transfers/[id]/receive/route.ts`

### 7. Frontend JavaScript Error
- **Problem:** Calling undefined function `fetchTransferDetails()`
- **Fix:** Removed call, use `window.location.reload()` instead
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed in `src/app/dashboard/transfers/[id]/page.tsx`

### 8. Serial Numbers Field Mismatch
- **Problem:** Trying to access `item.serialNumbers` (relation) instead of `serialNumbersSent` (JSON field)
- **Fix:** Updated to parse `serialNumbersSent` JSON field correctly
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

## 🎯 Next Steps for Company Owner

### To Verify the System:

1. **View Transfer Details:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3001/dashboard/transfers
   - Find TR-202510-0001
   - Verify status shows "Received"

2. **Check Stock Levels:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3001/dashboard/products/stock
   - Filter by Main Warehouse - verify stock decreased
   - Filter by Main Store - verify stock increased

3. **Review Inventory Ledger:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3001/dashboard/reports/inventory-ledger
   - Select one of the transferred products
   - Verify TRANSFER_OUT and TRANSFER_IN entries exist
   - Verify no variance or discrepancy

4. **Check Audit Trail:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3001/dashboard/reports/audit-trail
   - Filter by Stock Transfer entity type
   - Verify all workflow steps are logged

### To Test Reverse Direction:

**Main Store → Main Warehouse:**
1. Login as user at Main Store
2. Create transfer from Main Store to Main Warehouse
3. Follow the same 4-stage workflow
4. Verify inventory movements are correct

## 💡 Key Learnings

### 1. Serial Numbers Storage:
- Stored as **JSON fields** (`serialNumbersSent`, `serialNumbersReceived`)
- **NOT** stored as database relations
- Requires parsing when validating

### 2. Stock Deduction Timing:
- Stock deducted at **SEND** (stage 3), not RECEIVE
- Transfer status becomes `in_transit` when stock is deducted
- `stockDeducted` flag must be checked for ledger queries

### 3. Field Naming Conventions:
- Permissions use dots: `stock_transfer.view`
- Receiver notes stored in: `verifierNotes`
- Item quantity field: `receivedQuantity` (not `quantityReceived`)

### 4. Transfer Workflow Flexibility:
- Can skip optional verification stages (arrived → verifying → verified)
- Can go directly from `in_transit` → `received` (quick receive)
- Both detailed and quick workflows supported

### 5. ProductHistory Importance:
- **Critical** for inventory ledger accuracy
- Must include `in_transit` transfers when calculating stock
- Use `sentAt` for timing (when stock actually moved)
