## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Library: `src/lib/inventoryValuation.ts` ✅

**Purpose:** Calculates inventory value using FIFO, LIFO, or Weighted Average costing methods

**Features:**
- ✅ **FIFO (First In, First Out)** - Assumes oldest inventory sold first
- ✅ **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** - Assumes newest inventory sold first
- ✅ **Weighted Average Cost (AVCO)** - Average cost weighted by quantity
- ✅ **Cost Layer Tracking** - Tracks remaining quantities at different cost points
- ✅ **Per-Variation Valuation** - Calculate value for individual product variations
- ✅ **Per-Location Valuation** - Calculate value for specific business locations
- ✅ **Business-Wide Valuation** - Calculate total inventory value

**Key Functions:**
```typescript
// Get valuation for a single product variation at a location
getInventoryValuation(variationId, locationId, businessId, method?)

// Get valuation for all products at a location
getLocationInventoryValuation(locationId, businessId, method?)

// Get total inventory value for entire business
getTotalInventoryValue(businessId, locationId?, method?)
```

## How It Works

### Valuation Method: FIFO (First In, First Out)

**Process:**
1. Get all inbound stock transactions (purchases, transfers in) sorted by date (oldest first)
2. Get all outbound transactions (sales, transfers out) sorted by date
3. Build cost layers from inbound transactions
4. Consume cost layers in chronological order (oldest first)
5. Calculate value from remaining layers

**Example:**
```
Purchases:
- Jan 1: 100 units @ ₱10 = ₱1,000
- Feb 1: 50 units @ ₱12 = ₱600
Total: 150 units, ₱1,600

Sales:
- Mar 1: 80 units sold

FIFO Logic:
- Consume 80 from Jan 1 layer (oldest)
- Remaining: 20 units @ ₱10 + 50 units @ ₱12
- Total Value: ₱200 + ₱600 = ₱800
- Unit Cost: ₱800 / 70 units = ₱11.43
```

---

### Valuation Method: LIFO (Last In, First Out)

**Process:**
1. Get inbound transactions sorted by date (newest first)
2. Build cost layers
3. Consume cost layers in reverse chronological order (newest first)
4. Calculate value from remaining layers

**Example:**
```
Same purchases as above, same sales

LIFO Logic:
- Consume 50 from Feb 1 layer (newest)
- Consume 30 from Jan 1 layer
- Remaining: 70 units @ ₱10
- Total Value: ₱700
- Unit Cost: ₱700 / 70 units = ₱10
```

---

### Valuation Method: Weighted Average Cost

**Process:**
1. Get all inbound transactions
2. Calculate total cost = Σ(quantity × unitCost)
3. Calculate total quantity = Σ(quantity)
4. Weighted Average = total cost / total quantity
5. Current value = current quantity × weighted average

**Example:**
```
Same purchases as above

Weighted Avg Calculation:
- Total Cost: ₱1,600
- Total Quantity: 150 units
- Weighted Avg: ₱1,600 / 150 = ₱10.67

After sales (70 units remaining):
- Total Value: 70 × ₱10.67 = ₱746.90
- Unit Cost: ₱10.67
```

## Database Schema Support

### Existing Schema (Already in Place)

**Business Table:**
```sql
accountingMethod VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'fifo'
-- Values: 'fifo', 'lifo', 'avco'
```

**StockTransaction Table:**
```sql
id INT PRIMARY KEY
businessId INT
productVariationId INT
locationId INT
type VARCHAR(50)           -- purchase, sale, transfer_in, etc.
quantity DECIMAL(22,4)     -- Positive for IN, negative for OUT
unitCost DECIMAL(22,4)     -- Cost per unit
balanceQty DECIMAL(22,4)   -- Running balance
createdAt TIMESTAMP        -- Transaction date (for FIFO/LIFO ordering)
```

**No schema changes required!** ✅

---

## Usage Examples

### Setting Business Valuation Method

```sql
-- Set to FIFO
UPDATE businesses SET accounting_method = 'fifo' WHERE id = 1;

-- Set to LIFO
UPDATE businesses SET accounting_method = 'lifo' WHERE id = 1;

-- Set to Weighted Average
UPDATE businesses SET accounting_method = 'avco' WHERE id = 1;
```

### API Usage

```bash
# Get valuation for all locations using business default method
GET /api/reports/inventory-valuation

# Get valuation for specific location using FIFO
GET /api/reports/inventory-valuation?locationId=5&method=fifo

# Get valuation with cost layers and category grouping
GET /api/reports/inventory-valuation?includeLayers=true&groupByCategory=true
```

### Programmatic Usage

```typescript
import { getInventoryValuation, ValuationMethod } from '@/lib/inventoryValuation'

// Get valuation for a specific product variation
const valuation = await getInventoryValuation(
  variationId: 123,
  locationId: 5,
  businessId: 1,
  method: ValuationMethod.FIFO
)

console.log(`Current Qty: ${valuation.currentQty}`)
console.log(`Unit Cost: ${valuation.unitCost}`)
console.log(`Total Value: ${valuation.totalValue}`)

// Get total business inventory value
const total = await getTotalInventoryValue(businessId: 1)
console.log(`Total Inventory Value: ₱${total.totalValue}`)
```

## Comparison of Methods

### When to Use FIFO
✅ **Best For:** Perishable goods, retail, most businesses
✅ **Pros:**
- Matches physical flow of goods
- Higher inventory value during inflation
- Better gross profit in rising costs
- Widely accepted (GAAP, IFRS)

⚠️ **Cons:**
- More complex to calculate
- Requires cost layer tracking

### When to Use LIFO
✅ **Best For:** Non-perishables, inflationary environments
✅ **Pros:**
- Tax advantage during inflation
- Matches current costs to revenue
- Lower taxable income in rising costs

⚠️ **Cons:**
- **NOT allowed under IFRS**
- Can understate inventory value
- Complex layer tracking
- May not match physical flow

### When to Use Weighted Average
✅ **Best For:** Commodities, bulk items, most general inventory
✅ **Pros:**
- **Simplest to calculate**
- Smooths price fluctuations
- No cost layer tracking needed
- Acceptable under GAAP and IFRS

⚠️ **Cons:**
- Doesn't reflect actual flow
- Can lag behind price changes
- Average may not represent current costs

## Testing the Implementation

### Manual Test Steps

1. **Navigate to the Report:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/dashboard/reports/inventory-valuation
   ```

2. **Test Different Methods:**
   - Select "FIFO" method → Observe values
   - Select "LIFO" method → Compare values
   - Select "Weighted Average" → Compare values

3. **Test Location Filtering:**
   - Select "All Locations" → See all inventory
   - Select specific location → See only that location

4. **Test Category Grouping:**
   - Enable "Group by Category" → See grouped view
   - Disable grouping → See flat view

5. **Test Export:**
   - Click Excel export button
   - Verify exported data matches screen

### Expected Results

- ✅ FIFO should show **highest** value during inflation
- ✅ LIFO should show **lowest** value during inflation
- ✅ Weighted Average should be **in between**
