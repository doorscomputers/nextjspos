# Inventory Ledger TRANSFER_IN Fix

## üêõ Problem Found by User

**Issue:** Inventory Ledger showing **discrepancy/variance** at Main Store (destination location) after receiving transfer TR-202510-0001.

**Symptoms:**
- Calculated Balance: 0.00 units
- System Inventory: 2.00 units
- **Variance: -2.00 units** ‚ùå
- Message: "No transactions found in the selected period"

**Root Cause:** Inventory Ledger was NOT finding TRANSFER_IN transactions because:
1. Query only looked for `status: 'completed'` (transfer is `'received'`)
2. Query used `completedAt` field (should use `receivedAt`)

---

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

The Inventory Ledger route (`src/app/api/reports/inventory-ledger/route.ts`) had **4 locations** where TRANSFER_IN queries were incorrect:

### Issue 1: Baseline Transfers In (Before Start Date)
**Line 243-268** - Calculating opening balance from past transfers

**OLD CODE (BROKEN):**
```typescript
prisma.stockTransfer.findMany({
  where: {
    businessId,
    toLocationId: locId,
    status: 'completed',  // ‚ùå WRONG!
    completedAt: { lt: startDate },  // ‚ùå WRONG!
```

**Why Wrong:**
- Only finds transfers with `status = 'completed'`
- But our system uses `status = 'received'` when stock is received
- Uses `completedAt` which may be null or different from when stock actually arrived

---

### Issue 2: Main Period Transfers In
**Line 503-538** - Finding transfers IN during the report period

**OLD CODE (BROKEN):**
```typescript
prisma.stockTransfer.findMany({
  where: {
    businessId,
    toLocationId: locId,
    status: 'completed',  // ‚ùå WRONG!
    completedAt: {  // ‚ùå WRONG!
      gte: startDate,
      lte: endDate
    },
```

**Same Issue:**
- Doesn't find `'received'` status transfers
- Uses wrong date field

---

### Issue 3: Baseline Calculation Logic
**Line 337-344** - Processing transfers in baseline

**OLD CODE (BROKEN):**
```typescript
for (const transfer of transfersInBefore) {
  if ((transfer.completedAt || transfer.createdAt) > correctionDate) {  // ‚ùå WRONG!
    const item = transfer.items[0]
    if (item) {
      baselineQuantity += parseFloat(item.quantity.toString())
    }
  }
}
```

**Why Wrong:**
- Checks `completedAt` to determine if transfer happened after correction
- Should use `receivedAt` (when stock actually arrived)

---

### Issue 4: Transaction Record Creation
**Line 704-721** - Adding transfer IN to transaction list

**OLD CODE (BROKEN):**
```typescript
transactions.push({
  date: transfer.completedAt || transfer.createdAt,  // ‚ùå WRONG!
  type: 'Transfer In',
  referenceNumber: transfer.transferNumber,
  description: `Transfer In from ${transfer.fromLocation?.name || 'Unknown'} - TR #${transfer.transferNumber}`,
  quantityIn: parseFloat(item.quantity.toString()),
```

**Why Wrong:**
- Uses `completedAt` as transaction date
- Should use `receivedAt` (actual arrival date)

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Baseline Transfers In Query
**File:** `src/app/api/reports/inventory-ledger/route.ts`
**Lines:** 243-268

**NEW CODE (FIXED):**
```typescript
// Transfers In before start date
// NOTE: Use receivedAt because stock is added when received, not when completed
prisma.stockTransfer.findMany({
  where: {
    businessId,
    toLocationId: locId,
    status: {
      in: ['received', 'completed']  // ‚úÖ Accept both statuses
    },
    receivedAt: { lt: startDate },  // ‚úÖ Use receivedAt
    items: {
      some: {
        productId: prodId,
        productVariationId: varId
      }
    }
  },
```

---

### Fix 2: Main Period Transfers In Query
**Lines:** 506-538

**NEW CODE (FIXED):**
```typescript
// d) Stock Transferred In
// NOTE: Use receivedAt because stock is added when received, not when completed
prisma.stockTransfer.findMany({
  where: {
    businessId,
    toLocationId: locId,
    status: {
      in: ['received', 'completed']  // ‚úÖ Accept both statuses
    },
    receivedAt: {  // ‚úÖ Use receivedAt
      gte: startDate,
      lte: endDate
    },
    items: {
      some: {
        productId: prodId,
        productVariationId: varId
      }
    }
  },
  include: {
    items: {
      where: {
        productId: prodId,
        productVariationId: varId
      }
    },
    fromLocation: {
      select: { name: true }
    }
  },
  orderBy: { receivedAt: 'asc' }  // ‚úÖ Order by receivedAt
}),
```

---

### Fix 3: Baseline Calculation Logic
**Lines:** 337-344

**NEW CODE (FIXED):**
```typescript
for (const transfer of transfersInBefore) {
  if ((transfer.receivedAt || transfer.createdAt) > correctionDate) {  // ‚úÖ Use receivedAt
    const item = transfer.items[0]
    if (item) {
      baselineQuantity += parseFloat(item.quantity.toString())
    }
  }
}
```

---

### Fix 4: Transaction Record Creation
**Lines:** 704-721

**NEW CODE (FIXED):**
```typescript
for (const transfer of transfersIn) {
  const item = transfer.items[0]
  if (!item) continue

  transactions.push({
    date: transfer.receivedAt || transfer.createdAt,  // ‚úÖ Use receivedAt
    type: 'Transfer In',
    referenceNumber: transfer.transferNumber,
    description: `Transfer In from ${transfer.fromLocation?.name || 'Unknown'} - TR #${transfer.transferNumber}`,
    quantityIn: parseFloat(item.quantity.toString()),
    quantityOut: 0,
    runningBalance: 0,
    user: 'System',
    relatedLocation: transfer.fromLocation?.name,
    referenceId: transfer.id,
    referenceType: 'transfer_in'
  })
}
```

## üéØ What Changed - Summary

### Changed in 4 Places:

1. **Baseline query:** `status: 'completed'` ‚Üí `status: { in: ['received', 'completed'] }`
2. **Baseline query:** `completedAt: { lt: startDate }` ‚Üí `receivedAt: { lt: startDate }`
3. **Main period query:** Same status and date field changes
4. **Baseline calculation:** `transfer.completedAt` ‚Üí `transfer.receivedAt`
5. **Transaction date:** `transfer.completedAt` ‚Üí `transfer.receivedAt`

### Why These Changes?

**Status Field:**
- System uses `'received'` when transfer is completed at destination
- Old code only looked for `'completed'` status (which may not be used)
- Fix: Accept both `'received'` and `'completed'` statuses

**Date Field:**
- `receivedAt` = When stock actually arrived at destination (CORRECT)
- `completedAt` = Final completion timestamp (may be null or later)
- Stock is added to inventory when `receivedAt` is set, not `completedAt`

## üîÑ Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Refresh the Ledger Page
- Go to `http://localhost:3001/dashboard/reports/inventory-ledger`
- Select Location: **Main Store**
- Select Product: **2 DOOR DRAWER WITH LOCK 4 ADJUSTABLE SHELVES**
- Click "Generate Report"

### Step 2: Verify Transaction Shows
You should now see:
- ‚úÖ **Transfer In** transaction appears
- ‚úÖ Date: 2025-10-19 (when store_manager received it)
- ‚úÖ Quantity In: 2.00 units
- ‚úÖ Reference: TR-202510-0001
- ‚úÖ From: Main Warehouse

### Step 3: Verify No Discrepancy
At the bottom of the report:
- ‚úÖ Calculated Balance: **2.00 units**
- ‚úÖ System Inventory: **2.00 units**
- ‚úÖ Variance: **0.00 units**
- ‚úÖ Status: **Reconciliation Status: Match** (green) or no discrepancy warning

### Step 4: Check All 3 Transferred Products
Repeat for:
1. Product 824 (Chair) - 2 units
2. Product 306 - 3 units
3. Product 1329 - 2 units

All should show:
- ‚úÖ TRANSFER_IN transaction visible
- ‚úÖ No variance/discrepancy

---

## üîç Verification Script

We already verified via script that ProductHistory entries exist:

```
ProductHistory Entries: 6

TRANSFER_IN entries (Main Store):
  ‚úÖ Product 824: +2 units
  ‚úÖ Product 306: +3 units
  ‚úÖ Product 1329: +2 units
```

The Inventory Ledger should now FIND and DISPLAY these transactions!

---

## üí° Key Learnings

### 1. Status Field Consistency
- **TRANSFER_OUT** uses: `in_transit`, `received`, `completed`
- **TRANSFER_IN** uses: `received`, `completed`
- Ledger must check BOTH statuses, not just `completed`

### 2. Date Field Consistency
- **Stock deducted at SEND:** Use `sentAt`
- **Stock added at RECEIVE:** Use `receivedAt`
- Don't use `completedAt` for inventory movements

### 3. Ledger Accuracy Depends On:
- Correct status filtering
- Correct date field usage
- Matching ProductHistory transaction types
- Proper baseline calculations

---

## üìã Affected Areas

**ONLY affects Inventory Ledger report:**
- ‚úÖ TRANSFER_IN transactions now visible
- ‚úÖ Variance calculations now correct
- ‚úÖ Opening balance calculations now accurate

**Does NOT affect:**
- ‚ùå Actual stock levels (still correct)
- ‚ùå ProductHistory entries (still created correctly)
- ‚ùå Transfer workflow (still works)
- ‚ùå Other reports

**This was purely a REPORTING issue, not a data integrity issue!**

---

## üéâ Success Criteria

After this fix, you can confidently tell the company owner:

‚úÖ **Inventory Ledger is now accurate** - Shows all TRANSFER_IN transactions
‚úÖ **No more false discrepancies** - Variance should be 0.00
‚úÖ **Full audit trail visible** - Every transfer IN is recorded and visible
‚úÖ **System is trustworthy** - Calculations match reality

---

**Fixed:** October 19, 2025
**Issue:** TRANSFER_IN transactions not showing in Inventory Ledger
**Cause:** Using `completedAt` and `status: 'completed'` instead of `receivedAt` and `status: 'received'`
**Solution:** Updated 4 locations in ledger query logic
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED - Ready for Testing
